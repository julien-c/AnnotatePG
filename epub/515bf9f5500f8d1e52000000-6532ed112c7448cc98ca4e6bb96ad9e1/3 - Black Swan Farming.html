  <p><span class="s s3">
   I've done several types of work over the years but I don't know
another as counterintuitive as startup investing.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">The two most important things to understand about startup investing,
as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are
concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look
initially like bad ideas.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s6">The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn't really grasp till
it happened to us.</span>  <span class="s s7">The total value of the companies we've funded
is around 10 billion, give or take a few.</span>  <span class="s s8">But just two companies,
Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our
expectations about variation.</span>  <span class="s s11">I don't know whether these expectations
are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not
prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in
startup investing.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">That yields all sorts of strange consequences.</span>  <span class="s s14">For example, in
purely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in
each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,
and the rest are just a cost of doing business.</span><span class="s s15">

               I haven't
really assimilated that fact, partly because it's so counterintuitive,
and partly because we're not doing this just for financial reasons;
YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per
batch.</span>  <span class="s s16">And yet it's true.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s18">To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to
be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through
clouds.</span><span class="s s19">

   ]
                 
                 You need to do what you know intellectually to be
right, even though it feels wrong.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">It's a constant battle for us.</span>  <span class="s s22">It's hard to make ourselves take
enough risks.</span> <span class="s s23">When you interview a startup and think "they seem
likely to succeed," it's hard not to fund them.</span>  <span class="s s24">And yet, financially
at least, there is only one kind of success: they're either going
to be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn't
matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the
effect on your returns will be insignificant.</span>  <span class="s s25">In the same day of
interviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren't even
sure what they want to work on.</span> <span class="s s26">Their chances of succeeding seem
small.</span>  <span class="s s27">But again, it's not their chances of succeeding that matter
but their chances of succeeding really big.</span>  <span class="s s28">The probability that
any group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the
probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that
of the other, safer group.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s30">The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a
constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all.</span>
<span class="s s31">If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed
at all, and you'd get that fraction of big hits.</span>  <span class="s s32">Unfortunately
picking winners is harder than that.</span>  <span class="s s33">You have to ignore the elephant
in front of you, the likelihood they'll succeed, and focus instead
on the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether
they'll succeed really big.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s35">
   Harder
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s36">That's made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at
first like bad ideas.</span>  <span class="s s37">I've written about this before: if a good
idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it.</span>
<span class="s s38">So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few
beside them realize are good.</span>  <span class="s s39">Which is not that far from a description
of insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that
illustrates the situation perfectly.</span>  <span class="s s42">He drew two intersecting
circles, one labelled "seems like a bad idea" and the other "is a
good idea.</span><span class="s s43">"</span>  <span class="s s44">The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram
is illuminating.</span>  <span class="s s47">It reminds you that there is an intersection&acirc;&#128;&#148;that
there are good ideas that seem bad.</span>  <span class="s s48">It also reminds you that the
vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s50">The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even
harder to recognize the big winners.</span>  <span class="s s51">It means the probability of
a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction
of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with
a high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately
low probability of the latter.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s53">History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect
it seems obvious they were going to make it big.</span>  <span class="s s54">For that reason
one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to
me when I first heard about it.</span>  <span class="s s55">A site for college students to
waste time?</span>  <span class="s s56">It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche
market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s58">
   One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same
terms.

  <h3><span class="s s59">
   Harder Still
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s60">Wait, it gets worse.</span>  <span class="s s61">You not only have to solve this hard problem,
but you have to do it with no indication of whether you're succeeding.</span>
<span class="s s62">When you pick a big winner, you won't know it for two years.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s64">
   Meanwhile, the one thing you
   <i>
    can
   </i>
   measure is dangerously
misleading.</span>  <span class="s s65">The one thing we can track precisely is how well the
startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day.</span>  <span class="s s66">But we
know that's the wrong metric.</span>  <span class="s s67">There's no correlation between the
percentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does
matter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big
winner or not.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">Except an inverse one.</span>  <span class="s s70">That's the scary thing: fundraising is not
merely a useless metric, but positively misleading.</span>  <span class="s s71">We're in a
business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and
the huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our
net very widely.</span>  <span class="s s72">The big winners could generate 10,000x returns.</span>
<span class="s s73">That means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companies
that returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s75">If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded
were able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainly
mean we were being too conservative.</span><span class="s s76">

   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s77">It takes a conscious effort not to do that too.</span>  <span class="s s78">After 15 cycles
of preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do,
I can now look at a group we're interviewing through Demo Day
investors' eyes.</span>  <span class="s s79">But those are the wrong eyes to look through!</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s81">We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors.</span>
<span class="s s82">And since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford
to take more risk you should.</span>  <span class="s s83">What would it mean to take 10x more
risk than Demo Day investors?</span>  <span class="s s84">We'd have to be willing to fund 10x
more startups than they would.</span>  <span class="s s85">Which means that even if we're
generous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a
startup's expected value, we'd be taking the right amount of risk
if only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding
after Demo Day.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">I don't know what fraction of them currently raise more after Demo
Day.</span>  <span class="s s88">I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if you
start measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it's
the wrong thing to optimize.</span><span class="s s89">

                                                   But the percentage is certainly
way over 30%.</span>  <span class="s s90">And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate at
fundraising makes my stomach clench.</span>  <span class="s s91">A Demo Day where only 30% of
the startups were fundable would be a shambles.</span>  <span class="s s92">Everyone would
agree that YC had jumped the shark.</span> <span class="s s93">We ourselves would feel that
YC had jumped the shark.</span>  <span class="s s94">And yet we'd all be wrong.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s96">For better or worse that's never going to be more than a thought
experiment.</span>  <span class="s s97">We could never stand it.</span>  <span class="s s98">How about that for
counterintuitive?</span>  <span class="s s99">I can lay out what I know to be the right thing
to do, and still not do it.</span>  <span class="s s100">I can make up all sorts of plausible
justifications.</span>  <span class="s s101">It would hurt YC's brand (at least among the
innumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups that
flamed out.</span>  <span class="s s102">It might dilute the value of the alumni network.</span>
<span class="s s103">Perhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to be
up to our chins in failure all the time.</span>  <span class="s s104">But I know the real reason
we're so conservative is that we just haven't assimilated the fact
of 1000x variation in returns.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s106">We'll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risks
proportionate to the returns in this business.</span>  <span class="s s107">The best we can
hope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselves
thinking "they seem like good founders, but what are investors going
to think of this crazy idea?</span><span class="s s108">"</span> <span class="s s109">we'll continue to be able to say "who
cares what investors think?</span><span class="s s110">"</span>  <span class="s s111">That's what we thought about Airbnb,
and if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinking
it.</span>

I'm not saying that the big winners are all that matters, just
that they're all that matters financially for investors.</span>  <span class="s s115">Since
we're not doing YC mainly for financial reasons, the big winners
aren't all that matters to us.</span>  <span class="s s116">We're delighted to have funded
Reddit, for example.</span> <span class="s s117">Even though we made comparatively little from
it, Reddit has had a big effect on the world, and it introduced us
to Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both of whom have become good
friends.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s119">Nor do we push founders to try to become one of the big winners if
they don't want to.</span> <span class="s s120">We didn't "swing for the fences" in our own
startup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would
feel pretty bogus to press founders to do something we didn't do.</span>
<span class="s s121">Our rule is that it's up to the founders.</span>  <span class="s s122">Some want to take over
the world, and some just want that first few million.</span>  <span class="s s123">But we invest
in so many companies that we don't have to sweat any one outcome.</span>
<span class="s s124">In fact, we don't have to sweat whether startups have exits at all.</span>
<span class="s s125">The biggest exits are the only ones that matter financially, and
those are guaranteed in the sense that if a company becomes big
enough, a market for its shares will inevitably arise.</span>  <span class="s s126">Since the
remaining outcomes don't have a significant effect on returns, it's
cool with us if the founders want to sell early for a small amount,
or grow slowly and never sell (i.</span><span class="s s127">e.</span> <span class="s s128">become a so-called lifestyle
business), or even shut the company down.</span>  <span class="s s129">We're sometimes disappointed
when a startup we had high hopes for doesn't do well, but this
disappointment is mostly the ordinary variety that anyone feels
when that happens.</span>

A startup's success at fundraising is a function of two things:
what they're selling and how good they are at selling it.</span>  <span class="s s144">And while
we can teach startups a lot about how to appeal to investors, even
the most convincing pitch can't sell an idea that investors don't
like.</span>  <span class="s s145">I was genuinely worried that Airbnb, for example, would not
be able to raise money after Demo Day.</span><span class="s s146">  I couldn't convince
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/airbnb.html">
    Fred Wilson
   </a>
   to fund them.</span>  <span class="s s147">They might not
have raised money at all but for the coincidence that Greg Mcadoo,
our contact at Sequoia, was one of a handful of VCs who understood
the vacation rental business, having spent much of the previous two
years investigating it.</span>

I calculated it once for the last batch before a consortium of
investors started offering investment automatically to every startup
we funded, summer 2010.</span>  <span class="s s150">At the time it was 94% (33 of 35 companies
that tried to raise money succeeded, and one didn't try because
they were already profitable).</span>  <span class="s s151">Presumably it's lower now because
of that investment; in the old days it was raise after Demo Day or
die.</span>
