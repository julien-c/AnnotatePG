    I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for
    </span><nota href="href=" http: note-to-washington-about-half-of-vc-backed-company-founders-are-immigrants venturebeat.com><span class="s s4">
     startup founders
         .
    </span></nota></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s5">The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.</span>  <span class="s s6">It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.</span>  <span class="s s9">If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.</span><span class="s s10">
    <i>
     Each year.
    </i>
    They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.</span>  <span class="s s13">In fact they'd cause there to be 
more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup.</span> <span class="s s16">But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.</span>  <span class="s s17">Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.</span>  <span class="s s18">The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">How would the government decide who's a startup investor?</span>  <span class="s s21">The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas.</span> <span class="s s22">We'll establish our own accreditation procedure.</span> <span class="s s23">We know who one another are.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.</span>  <span class="s s26">I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.</span>  <span class="s s27">The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.</span>
