   I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such
uniquely useless discussions.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates
into a religious argument.</span>  <span class="s s5">Why?</span>  <span class="s s6">Why does this happen with religion
and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about
on forums?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s8">What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need
to have any particular expertise to have opinions about
it.</span>  <span class="s s9">All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have
those.</span>  <span class="s s10">No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about
religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold
of expertise to post comments about that.</span>  <span class="s s11">But on religion everyone's
an expert.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too.</span>  <span class="s s14">Politics,
like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise
for expressing an opinion.</span>  <span class="s s15">All you need is strong convictions.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">Do religion and politics have something in common that explains
this similarity?</span>  <span class="s s18">One possible explanation is that they deal with
questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure
on people's opinions.</span>  <span class="s s19">Since no one can be proven wrong, every
opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with
theirs.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">But this isn't true.</span>  <span class="s s22">There are certainly some political questions
that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy
will cost.</span>  <span class="s s23">But the more precise political questions suffer the
same fate as the vaguer ones.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s25">I think what religion and politics have in common is that they
become part of people's identity, and people can never have a
fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity.</span>
<span class="s s26">By definition they're partisan.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not
the topic.</span>  <span class="s s29">For example, a discussion about a battle that included
citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably
degenerate into a political argument.</span>  <span class="s s30">But a discussion today about
a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't.</span>  <span class="s s31">No
one would know what side to be on.</span>  <span class="s s32">So it's not politics that's the
source of the trouble, but identity.</span>  <span class="s s33">When people say a discussion
has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that
it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.</span><span class="s s34">

   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s35">Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather
than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question
tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer.</span> <span class="s s36">For example,
the question of the relative merits of programming languages often
degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers
identify as X programmers or Y programmers.</span>  <span class="s s37">This sometimes leads
people to conclude the question must be unanswerable&acirc;&#128;&#148;that all
languages are equally good.</span>  <span class="s s38">Obviously that's false: anything else
people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be
uniquely impossible for programming languages?</span>  <span class="s s39">And indeed, you can
have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming
languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic
only if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the
participants.</span>  <span class="s s42">What makes politics and religion such minefields is
that they engage so many people's identities.</span>  <span class="s s43">But you could in
principle have a useful conversation about them with some people.</span><span class="s s44">
And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the
relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't
safely talk about with

    others
   </a>
   .</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that
it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how
to have better ideas.</span>  <span class="s s47">If people can't think clearly about anything
that has become part of their identity, then all other things being
equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as
possible.</span><span class="s s48">

  <p>
   <span class="s s49">Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.</span>  <span class="s s50">But there
is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not
even to consider yourself an x.</span>  <span class="s s51">The more labels you have for
yourself, the dumber they make you.</span>

When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going
critical.</span>  <span class="s s55">The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which
brings in more people.</span>  <span class="s s56">And they tend to say incendiary things,
which draw more and angrier counterarguments.</span>

There may be some things it's a net win to include in your
identity.</span>  <span class="s s59">For example, being a scientist.</span>  <span class="s s60">But arguably that is
more of a placeholder than an actual label&acirc;&#128;&#148;like putting NMI on a
form that asks for your middle initial&acirc;&#128;&#148;because it doesn't commit
you to believing anything in particular.</span>   <span class="s s61">A scientist isn't committed
to believing in natural selection in the same way a bibilical
literalist is committed to rejecting it.</span>  <span class="s s62">All he's committed to is
following the evidence wherever it leads.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s64">Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign
in a cupboard saying "this cupboard must be kept empty.</span><span class="s s65">"</span>  <span class="s s66">Yes,
strictly speaking, you're putting something in the cupboard, but
not in the ordinary sense.</span>
