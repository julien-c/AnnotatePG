   <p>
    <span class="s s3">Does "Web 2.</span><span class="s s4">0" mean anything?</span>  <span class="s s5">Till recently I thought it didn't,
but the truth turns out to be more complicated.</span>  <span class="s s6">Originally, yes,
it was meaningless.</span>  <span class="s s7">Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.</span>  <span class="s s8">And
yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it
means what I think it does, we don't need it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s10">I first heard the phrase "Web 2.</span><span class="s s11">0" in the name of the Web 2.</span><span class="s s12">0
conference in 2004.</span>  <span class="s s13">At the time it was supposed to mean using "the
web as a platform," which I took to refer to web-based applications.</span><span class="s s14">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly
led a session intended to figure out a definition of "Web 2.</span><span class="s s16">0.</span><span class="s s17">"</span>
<span class="s s18">Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform?</span>  <span class="s s19">And if it
didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s21">
    Origins
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s22">Tim says the phrase "Web 2.</span><span class="s s23">0" first
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20%0A.html">
     arose
    </a>
    in "a brainstorming session between
O'Reilly and Medialive International.</span><span class="s s24">"</span> <span class="s s25">What is Medialive International?</span>
<span class="s s26">"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences," according to
their site.</span>  <span class="s s27">So presumably that's what this brainstorming session
was about.</span>  <span class="s s28">O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,
and they were wondering what to call it.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s30">
    I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a
new
    <i>
     version
    </i>
    of the web.</span>  <span class="s s31">They just wanted to make the point
that the web mattered again.</span>  <span class="s s32">It was a kind of semantic deficit
spending: they knew new things were coming, and the "2.</span><span class="s s33">0" referred
to whatever those might turn out to be.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">And they were right.</span>  <span class="s s36">New things were coming.</span>  <span class="s s37">But the new version
number led to some awkwardness in the short term.</span>  <span class="s s38">In the process
of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have
decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that "2.</span><span class="s s39">0"
referred to.</span>  <span class="s s40">Whatever it meant, "the web as a platform" was at
least not too constricting.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s42">The story about "Web 2.</span><span class="s s43">0" meaning the web as a platform didn't live
much past the first conference.</span>  <span class="s s44">By the second conference, what
"Web 2.</span><span class="s s45">0" seemed to mean was something about democracy.</span>  <span class="s s46">At least,
it did when people wrote about it online.</span>  <span class="s s47">The conference itself
didn't seem very grassroots.</span>  <span class="s s48">It cost $2800, so the only people who
could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s50">
    And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69114,00.html">
     article
    </a>
    about the conference in
    <i>
     Wired News
    </i>
    spoke of "throngs of
geeks.</span><span class="s s51">"</span>  <span class="s s52">When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news
to him.</span>  <span class="s s53">He said he'd originally written something like "throngs
of VCs and biz dev guys" but had later shortened it just to "throngs,"
and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into
"throngs of geeks.</span><span class="s s54">"</span>  <span class="s s55">After all, a Web 2.</span><span class="s s56">0 conference would presumably
be full of geeks, right?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s58">Well, no.</span>  <span class="s s59">There were about 7.</span>  <span class="s s60">Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a   
suit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first.</span>  <span class="s s61">I saw
him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people "that guy looks
just like Tim.</span><span class="s s62">"</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s64">
    "Oh, that's Tim.  He bought a suit."
I ran after him, and sure enough, it was.  He explained that he'd
just bought it in Thailand.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s65">The 2005 Web 2.</span><span class="s s66">0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows
during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot
startup.</span>  <span class="s s67">There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large  
number of people determined not to miss out.</span>  <span class="s s68">Miss out on what?</span>
<span class="s s69">They didn't know.</span>  <span class="s s70">Whatever was going to happen&acirc;&#128;&#148;whatever Web 2.</span><span class="s s71">0
turned out to be.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s73">I wouldn't quite call it "Bubble 2.</span><span class="s s74">0" just because VCs are eager
to invest again.</span>  <span class="s s75">The Internet is a genuinely big deal.</span><span class="s s76">  The bust
was as much an
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bubble.html">
     overreaction
    </a>
    as
the boom.</span>  <span class="s s77">It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of
the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there
was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s79">The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO
market is gone.</span><span class="s s80">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html">
     Venture investors
    </a>
    are driven by exit strategies.</span>  <span class="s s81">The reason they were funding all  
those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped
to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing
all the way to the bank.</span>  <span class="s s82">Now that route is closed.</span>  <span class="s s83">Now the default
exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to
irrational exuberance than IPO investors.</span>  <span class="s s84">The closest you'll get 
to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for   
Myspace.</span>  <span class="s s85">That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s87">
    1. Ajax
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s88">Does "Web 2.</span><span class="s s89">0" mean anything more than the name of a conference
yet?</span>  <span class="s s90">I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to.</span>  <span class="s s91">When people
say "Web 2.</span><span class="s s92">0" now, I have some idea what they mean.</span>  <span class="s s93">And the fact
that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof
that it has started to mean something.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s95">One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still
only just bear to use without scare quotes.</span>  <span class="s s96">Basically, what "Ajax"
means is "Javascript now works.</span><span class="s s97">"</span>  <span class="s s98">And that in turn means that
web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop
ones.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s100">
    As you read this, a whole new
    <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113098635587487074.html?mod=todays_%0Afree_feature">
     generation
    </a>
    of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.</span>  <span class="s s101">There
hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers
first appeared.</span><span class="s s102">  Even Microsoft sees it, but it's too late for them
to do anything more than
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hypercamp.org/2005/11/09">
     leak
    </a>
    "internal"  
documents designed to give the impression they're on top of this
new trend.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s104">In fact the new generation of software is being written way too
fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own
in house.</span>  <span class="s s105">Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups
before Google does.</span>  <span class="s s106">And even that's going to be hard, because
Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did
in search a few years ago.</span><span class="s s107">  After all, Google Maps, the canonical
Ajax application, was the result of a startup they
    <a target="_blank" href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2005/10/google-maps-lead-engineer-gaze%0As-into.html">
     bought
    </a>
    .</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s109">So ironically the original description of the Web 2.</span><span class="s s110">0 conference
turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big
component of Web 2.</span><span class="s s111">0.</span>  <span class="s s112">But I'm convinced they got this right by 
accident.</span><span class="s s113">  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google
Maps appeared and the term "Ajax" was

     coined

examples to prove that
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html">

    can

     Wikipedia

    may be the most famous.</span>  <span class="s s120">Experts have given Wikipedia middling
reviews, but they miss the critical point: it's good enough.</span>  <span class="s s121">And   
it's free, which means people actually read it.</span>  <span class="s s122">On the web, articles
you have to pay for might as well not exist.</span>  <span class="s s123">Even if you were    
willing to pay to read them yourself, you can't link to them.</span>    
<span class="s s124">They're not part of the conversation.</span>

    <span class="s s126">Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as

                                                    I know if something major
happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it   
will show up there.</span>  <span class="s s129">Why bother checking the front page of any
specific paper or magazine?</span>  <span class="s s130">Reddit's like an RSS feed for the whole

    , the collaborative
bookmarking network that set off the "tagging" movement.</span>  <span class="s s132">And whereas
Wikipedia's main appeal is that it's good enough and free, these
sites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human
editors.</span>

   <p><span class="s s134">
    The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection
of ideas, but their production.
    </span><!-- Usage has not yet evolved to reflect
this: the only phrases we have to describe the phenomenon are ones 
that implicitly assume the superiority of the old order, like
"user-generated content," or "blogging" (neutral in itself, but 
revealingly condescending in its over-broad use).
--><span class="s s135">
    I've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's
sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers
and magazines.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links
on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather  
than to magazine articles or news stories.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s136">My experience of writing
for magazines suggests an explanation.</span>  <span class="s s137">Editors.</span>  <span class="s s138">They control the
topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever
you produce.</span>  <span class="s s139">The result is to damp extremes.</span>  <span class="s s140">Editing yields 95th
percentile writing&acirc;&#128;&#148;95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are
dragged down.</span>  <span class="s s141">5% of the time you get "throngs of geeks.</span><span class="s s142">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s144">On the web, people can publish whatever they want.</span>  <span class="s s145">Nearly all of
it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.</span>
<span class="s s146">But the pool of writers is very, very large.</span>  <span class="s s147">If it's large enough,
the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass  
the best in print.</span><span class="s s148">

startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.</span>  <span class="s s153">During

blowing through several million dollars of VC money to "get big
fast" in the most literal sense.</span><span class="s s154">  Now it means a smaller,

   <p>
    <span class="s s168">I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving
something away for free, and till recently a company giving anything
away for free could be pretty high-handed about it.</span>  <span class="s s169">Sometimes it

   <h3><span class="s s222">
    The Common Thread
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s223">Ajax, democracy, and not dissing users.</span>  <span class="s s224">What do they all have in  
common?</span>  <span class="s s225">I didn't realize they had anything in common till recently,
which is one of the reasons I disliked the term "Web 2.</span><span class="s s226">0" so much.</span>
<span class="s s227">It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened
to be new&acirc;&#128;&#148;that it didn't predict anything.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s229">But there is a common thread.</span>  <span class="s s230">Web 2.</span><span class="s s231">0 means using the web the way
it's meant to be used.</span>  <span class="s s232">The "trends" we're seeing now are simply
the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models
that got imposed on it during the Bubble.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s234">
    I realized this when I read an
    </span><!-- as-yet unpublished--><span class="s s235">
    interview with
Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.
                                                                                        
                                                                                         [

    </span></a><span class="s s237">
    ]
    </span></p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s238">Excite really never got the business model right at all.</span>  <span class="s s239">We fell 
  into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it
  adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old
  medium&acirc;&#128;&#148;which fails, and then the more appropriate models get
  figured out.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s241">
    It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years
after the Bubble burst.  But in retrospect, something was happening:
the web was finding its natural angle of repose.  The democracy 
component, for example&acirc;&#128;&#148;that's not an innovation, in the sense of
something someone made happen.  That's what the web naturally tends
to produce.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s242">Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the
web.</span>  <span class="s s243">That idea is almost as old as the web.</span>  <span class="s s244">But the first time    
around it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets.</span>  <span class="s s245">Java has
since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996
the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.</span>
<span class="s s246">Instead of desktop applications, you'd run Java "applets" delivered
from a server.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s248">This plan collapsed under its own weight.</span> <span class="s s249">Microsoft helped kill it,
but it would have died anyway.</span>  <span class="s s250">There was no uptake among hackers.</span><span class="s s251">
When you find
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/submarine.html">
     PR firms
    </a>
    promoting
something as the next development platform, you can be sure it's
not.</span><span class="s s252">  If it were, you wouldn't need PR firms to tell you, because   
hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites    
like
    <a target="_blank" href="http://busmonster.com">
     Busmonster
    </a>
    used Google Maps as a
platform before Google even meant it to be one.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s254">The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of  
hackers have spontaneously started building things on top
of it.</span>  <span class="s s255">Mikey likes it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s257">There's another thing all three components of Web 2.</span><span class="s s258">0 have in common.</span>
<span class="s s259">Here's a clue.</span>  <span class="s s260">Suppose you approached investors with the following
idea for a Web 2.</span><span class="s s261">0 startup:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s262">Sites like del.</span><span class="s s263">icio.</span><span class="s s264">us and flickr allow users to "tag" content
  with descriptive tokens.</span><span class="s s265">  But there is also huge source of
     <i>
      implicit
     </i>
     tags that they ignore: the text within web links.</span>
  <span class="s s266">Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the   
  individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using
  graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the
  reputation of each member.</span>  <span class="s s267">We plan to mine the web for these 
  implicit tags, and use them together with the reputation hierarchy
  they embody to enhance web searches.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s269">
    How long do you think it would take them on average to realize that
it was a description of Google?
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s270">Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.</span><span class="s s271">0: their core
business sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.</span><span class="s s272">0 terms, 
"Don't maltreat users" is a subset of "Don't be evil," and of course
Google set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s274">
    Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used, and Google
does.  That's their secret.
    </span><!-- The web naturally has a certain grain,
and Google is aligned with it.  That's why their success seems so   
effortless.--><span class="s s275">
    They're sailing with the wind, instead of sitting  
becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or   
trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and 
the record labels.

   <p>
    <span class="s s278">Google doesn't try to force things to happen their way.</span>  <span class="s s279">They try   
to figure out what's going to happen, and arrange to be standing 
there when it does.</span>  <span class="s s280">That's the way to approach technology&acirc;&#128;&#148;and 
as business includes an ever larger technological component, the
right way to do business.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s282">The fact that Google is a "Web 2.</span><span class="s s283">0" company shows that, while
meaningful, the term is also rather bogus.</span>  <span class="s s284">It's like the word
"allopathic.</span><span class="s s285">"</span>  <span class="s s286">It just means doing things right, and it's a bad   
sign when you have a special word for that.</span>
