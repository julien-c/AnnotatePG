   A user on Hacker News recently posted a

    comment

   that set me thinking:

    <span class="s s4">Something about hacker culture that never really set well with
  me was this&mdash;the nastiness.</span> <span class="s s5">.</span><span class="s s6">.</span><span class="s s7">.</span> <span class="s s8">I just don't understand why people
  troll like they do.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s10">
   I've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of
trolls.  It's an old one, as old as forums, but
we're still just learning what the causes are and how to address
them.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s11">There are two senses of the word "troll.</span><span class="s s12">"</span>  <span class="s s13">In the original sense
it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up
fights in a forum by saying controversial things.</span><span class="s s14">
         
          [

   ]
         
         For example,
someone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to
a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks
about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.</span>  <span class="s s15">This
sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting
a bat loose in a room full of people.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in
forums, whether intentionally or not.</span>  <span class="s s18">Now when people talk about
trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.</span>  <span class="s s19">Though
in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways
more accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it's usually
uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate.</span>
<span class="s s20">That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.</span>  <span class="s s23">The most
important is distance.</span>  <span class="s s24">People will say things in anonymous forums
that they'd never dare say to someone's face, just as they'll do
things in cars that they'd never do as pedestrians&mdash;like tailgate
people, or honk at them, or cut them off.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers,
and I think that's due to the kind of people you find there.</span>  <span class="s s27">Most
of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract
ideas than with people.</span>  <span class="s s28">Hackers can be abrupt even in person.</span>  <span class="s s29">Put
them on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s31">The third cause of trolling is incompetence.</span>  <span class="s s32">If you disagree with
something, it's easier to say "you suck" than to figure out and
explain exactly what you disagree with.</span>  <span class="s s33">You're also safe that way
from refutation.</span>  <span class="s s34">In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti.</span>
<span class="s s35">Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence:
people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other way
to do it than literally making a mark on the world.</span><span class="s s36">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s37">The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum.</span><span class="s s38">  Trolls
are like children (many
   <i>
    are
   </i>
   children) in that they're capable of
a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be
tolerated.</span>  <span class="s s39">In a place where rudeness isn't tolerated, most can be
polite.</span>  <span class="s s40">But vice versa as well.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s42">There's a sort of Gresham's Law of trolls: trolls are willing to
use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful
people aren't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it.</span>
<span class="s s43">Which means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the
dominant culture.</span>  <span class="s s44">That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by
the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched
it happen to Reddit.</span>

    <span class="s s46">News.</span><span class="s s47">YC
                        is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate
can be avoided.</span><span class="s s48">  The sites's
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">
     guidelines
    </a>
    explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn't say face to
face.</span>  <span class="s s49">If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and
tell them to stop.</span>  <span class="s s50">And when people seem to be deliberately trolling,
we ban them ruthlessly.</span>
   </xa></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">Technical tweaks may also help.</span>  <span class="s s53">On Reddit, votes on your comments
don't affect your karma score, but they do on News.</span><span class="s s54">YC.</span>  <span class="s s55">And it does
seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the
eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.</span>
<span class="s s56">Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s58">One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial
ideas, but empirically that doesn't seem to be what happens.</span>  <span class="s s59">When
people say something substantial that gets modded down, they
stubbornly leave it up.</span>  <span class="s s60">What people delete are wisecracks, because
they have less invested in them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s62">So far the experiment seems to be working.</span>  <span class="s s63">The level of conversation
on News.</span><span class="s s64">YC is as high as on any forum I've seen.</span>  <span class="s s65">But we still only
have about 8,000 uniques a day.</span>  <span class="s s66">The conversations on Reddit were
good when it was that small.</span>  <span class="s s67">The challenge is whether we can keep
things this way.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">I'm optimistic we will.</span>  <span class="s s70">We're not depending just on technical
tricks.</span>  <span class="s s71">The core users of News.</span><span class="s s72">YC are mostly refugees from other
sites that were overrun by trolls.</span>  <span class="s s73">They feel about trolls roughly
the way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships.</span>
<span class="s s74">So there are a lot of people working to keep this from happening
again.</span>

I mean forum in the general sense of a place to exchange views.</span>
<span class="s s78">The original Internet forums were not web sites but Usenet newsgroups.</span>

I'm talking here about everyday tagging.</span>  <span class="s s81">Some graffiti is
quite impressive (anything becomes art if you do it well enough)
but the median tag is just visual spam.</span>
