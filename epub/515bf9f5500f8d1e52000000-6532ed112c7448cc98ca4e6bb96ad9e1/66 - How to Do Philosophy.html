    How to Do Philosophy
   </span></h1>

    September 2007
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.</span>
<span class="s s4">I had several motives, some more honorable than others.</span>  <span class="s s5">One of the
less honorable was to shock people.</span>  <span class="s s6">College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.</span>  <span class="s s7">Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">But I had some more honest motives as well.</span>  <span class="s s10">I thought studying
philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.</span>  <span class="s s11">All the people
majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain
knowledge.</span>  <span class="s s12">I would be learning what was really what.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s14">I'd tried to read a few philosophy books.</span>  <span class="s s15">Not recent ones; you
wouldn't find those in our high school library.</span>  <span class="s s16">But I tried to
read Plato and Aristotle.</span>  <span class="s s17">I doubt I believed I understood them,
but they sounded like they were talking about something important.</span>
<span class="s s18">I assumed I'd learn what in college.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">The summer before senior year I took some college classes.</span>  <span class="s s21">I learned
a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy
101.</span>  <span class="s s22">And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.</span>  <span class="s s23">It was
my fault I hadn't learned anything.</span>  <span class="s s24">I hadn't read the books we
were assigned carefully enough.</span><span class="s s25">  I'd give Berkeley's
    <i>
     Principles
of Human Knowledge
    </i>
    another shot in college.</span>  <span class="s s26">Anything so admired
and so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could
only figure out what.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.</span>  <span class="s s29">I have
a nice edition of his collected works.</span>  <span class="s s30">Will I ever read it?</span>  <span class="s s31">Seems
unlikely.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">The difference between then and now is that now I understand why
Berkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.</span>  <span class="s s34">I think I see
now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s36">
    Words
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s37">I did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.</span>  <span class="s s38">It
didn't work out as I'd hoped.</span>  <span class="s s39">I didn't learn any magical truths
compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.</span>  <span class="s s40">But
I do at least know now why I didn't.</span>  <span class="s s41">Philosophy doesn't really
have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other
university subjects do.</span>  <span class="s s42">There is no core of knowledge one must
master.</span>  <span class="s s43">The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various
individual philosophers have said about different topics over the
years.</span>  <span class="s s44">Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten
who discovered what they discovered.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s46">Formal logic has some subject matter.</span> <span class="s s47">I took several classes in
logic.</span>  <span class="s s48">I don't know if I learned anything from them.</span><span class="s s49">

                         It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in
one's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of
possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a
couple things changed.</span>  <span class="s s50">But did studying logic teach me the importance
of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?</span>  <span class="s s51">I don't know.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s53">There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.</span>  <span class="s s54">The
most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of
freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.</span>  <span class="s s55">I learned
that I don't exist.</span><span class="s s56">  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that
lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself
    <i>
     I
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s57">But
there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.</span>
<span class="s s58">You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.</span>  <span class="s s59">Which means
your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each
transplanted into different bodies.</span>  <span class="s s60">Imagine waking up after such
an operation.</span>  <span class="s s61">You have to imagine being two people.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s63">The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life
are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.</span><span class="s s64">  Even a concept as
dear to us as
    <i>
     I
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s65">It took me a while to grasp this, but when I
did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century
grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been
told as a child was all wrong.</span><span class="s s66">

                             Outside of math there's a limit
to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad
definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise
meanings.</span>  <span class="s s67">Everyday words are inherently imprecise.</span>  <span class="s s68">They work well
enough in everyday life that you don't notice.</span>  <span class="s s69">Words seem to work,
just as Newtonian physics seems to.</span>  <span class="s s70">But you can always make them
break if you push them far enough.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s72">I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the
central fact of philosophy.</span>  <span class="s s73">Most philosophical debates are not
merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.</span>  <span class="s s74">Do we
have free will?</span>  <span class="s s75">Depends what you mean by "free.</span><span class="s s76">"</span> <span class="s s77">Do abstract ideas
exist?</span>  <span class="s s78">Depends what you mean by "exist.</span><span class="s s79">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s81">Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical
controversies are due to confusions over language.</span>  <span class="s s82">I'm not sure
how much credit to give him.</span>  <span class="s s83">I suspect a lot of people realized
this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than
becoming philosophy professors.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s85">How did things get this way?</span>  <span class="s s86">Can something people have spent
thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?</span>  <span class="s s87">Those are
interesting questions.</span>  <span class="s s88">In fact, some of the most interesting
questions you can ask about philosophy.</span>  <span class="s s89">The most valuable way to
approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get
lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down
like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone
wrong.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s91">
    History
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">Western philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.</span>
<span class="s s93">What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references
in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative
cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.</span>  <span class="s s94">Presumably they
were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent
cosmologies.</span><span class="s s95">

    <a name="f3" href="#f3n">

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s96">With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition
turned a corner.</span>  <span class="s s97">There started to be a lot more analysis.</span>  <span class="s s98">I suspect
Plato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.</span>
<span class="s s99">Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out
in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories
about them.</span><span class="s s100">
                                         
                                          [

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s101">People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize
what a leap it must have been when they first started to.</span>  <span class="s s102">It was
presumably many thousands of years between when people first started
describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked "what is
heat?</span><span class="s s103">"</span>  <span class="s s104">No doubt it was a very gradual process.</span>  <span class="s s105">We don't know if
Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they
did.</span>  <span class="s s106">But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large
scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them
that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,
at least.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s108">Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens
when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that
they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory
in one lifetime.</span>  <span class="s s109">If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of
thinking was.</span><span class="s s110">

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s111">This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive
and yet naive and mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s112">It was impressive even to ask the
questions they did.</span>  <span class="s s113">That doesn't mean they always came up with
good answers.</span>  <span class="s s114">It's not considered insulting to say that ancient
Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked
some concepts that would have made their lives easier.</span>  <span class="s s115">So I hope
people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers
were similarly naive.</span>  <span class="s s116">In particular, they don't seem to have fully
grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that
words break if you push them too far.</span>

    <span class="s s118">"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,"
Rod Brooks wrote, "programs written for them usually did not work.</span><span class="s s119">"</span><span class="s s120">

                                                 Something similar happened when people first started trying
to talk about abstractions.</span>  <span class="s s121">Much to their surprise, they didn't
arrive at answers they agreed upon.</span>  <span class="s s122">In fact, they rarely seemed
to arrive at answers at all.</span>

    They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at
too low a resolution.

how little effect they have.</span><span class="s s126">  No one after reading Aristotle's
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    does anything differently as a result.</span><span class="s s127">

   <p>
    <span class="s s128">Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications
to be interesting?</span>  <span class="s s129">No, they may not have to.</span>  <span class="s s130">Hardy's boast that
number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.</span>  <span class="s s131">But
he turned out to be mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s132">In fact, it's suspiciously hard to
find a field of math that truly has no practical use.</span><span class="s s133">  And Aristotle's
explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    implies that philosophy should be useful too.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s135">
    Theoretical Knowledge
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s136">Aristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.</span>
<span class="s s137">The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds
things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more
because he grasps the underlying principles.</span>  <span class="s s138">The trend is clear:
the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.</span>  <span class="s s139">But then
he makes a mistake&acirc;&#128;&#148;possibly the most important mistake in the
history of philosophy.</span>  <span class="s s140">He has noticed that theoretical knowledge
is often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than
for any practical need.</span>  <span class="s s141">So he proposes there are two kinds of
theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and
some that isn't.</span>  <span class="s s142">Since people interested in the latter are interested
in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.</span><span class="s s143">  So he sets as his
goal in the
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    the exploration of knowledge that has no
practical use.</span>  <span class="s s144">Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand
but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea
of words.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s146">His mistake was to confuse motive and result.</span>  <span class="s s147">Certainly, people
who want a deep understanding of something are often driven by
curiosity rather than any practical need.</span>  <span class="s s148">But that doesn't mean
what they end up learning is useless.</span>  <span class="s s149">It's very valuable in practice
to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're
never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts
in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down
in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you
didn't understand.</span>  <span class="s s150">Knowledge is power.</span>  <span class="s s151">That's what makes theoretical
knowledge prestigious.</span>  <span class="s s152">It's also what causes smart people to be
curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so
disinterested as we might think.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s154">So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications
to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will
surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s156">
    The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    was
partly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most
abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.</span>
<span class="s s157">He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of
him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s159">And since his work became the map used by generations of future
explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well.</span><span class="s s160">
                                                                   
                                                                    [

                                                                   Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of
outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing
the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had
to be useless.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s162">
    The
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    is mostly a failed experiment.</span>  <span class="s s163">A few ideas from
it turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effect
at all.</span><span class="s s164">  The
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    is among the least read of all famous
books.</span><span class="s s165">  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's
    <i>
     Principia
    </i>
    is, but the way a garbled message is.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s167">Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.</span><span class="s s168">  But unfortunately
that was not the conclusion Aristotle's successors derived from
works like the
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    .</span><span class="s s169">

fell on intellectual hard times.</span>  <span class="s s170">Instead of version 1s to be
superseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts
to be mastered and discussed.</span>  <span class="s s171">And so things remained for a shockingly
long time.</span>  <span class="s s172">It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center
of gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident
enough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of mistakes.</span>  <span class="s s173">And
even then they rarely said so outright.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s175">If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little
progress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the
Renaissance.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s177">
    In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it
was not only acceptable to produce works like the
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    ,
but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a
class of people called philosophers.</span>  <span class="s s178">No one thought to go back and
debug Aristotle's motivating argument.</span>  <span class="s s179">And so instead of correcting
the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it&acirc;&#128;&#148;that you can
easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas&acirc;&#128;&#148;they 
continued to fall into it.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s181">
    The Singularity
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s182">Curiously, however, the works they produced continued to attract
new readers.</span>  <span class="s s183">Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity
in this respect.</span>  <span class="s s184">If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,
you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to
inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.</span>  <span class="s s185">Till one knows
better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand
because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like
a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas
it represents are hard to understand.</span>  <span class="s s186">To someone who hasn't learned
the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:
as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.</span>
<span class="s s187">That was what lured me in as a high school student.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s189">This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense
built in.</span>  <span class="s s190">When things are hard to understand, people who suspect
they're nonsense generally keep quiet.</span>  <span class="s s191">There's no way to prove a

    A Proposal
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s217">We may be able to do better.</span>  <span class="s s218">Here's an intriguing possibility.</span>
<span class="s s219">Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what
he did.</span><span class="s s220">  The goal he announces in the
    <i>
     Metaphysics
    </i>
    seems one worth
pursuing: to discover the most general truths.</span>  <span class="s s221">That sounds good.</span>
<span class="s s222">But instead of trying to discover them because they're useless,
let's try to discover them because they're useful.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s224">I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised
criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering
off into a swamp of abstractions.</span>  <span class="s s225">Instead of trying to answer the
question:</span>
    </p><blockquote><span class="s s226">
     What are the most general truths?
    </span></blockquote><span class="s s227">
    let's try to answer the question
    </span><blockquote><span class="s s228">
     Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?
    </span></blockquote><span class="s s229">
    The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read
what we've written to do anything differently afterward.  Knowing
we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from
straying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.
   
   </span><p><span class="s s230">
    The goal is the same as Aristotle's; we just approach it from a
different direction.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s231">As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of the
controlled experiment.</span>  <span class="s s232">There's an idea that has turned out to be
widely applicable.</span>  <span class="s s233">Some might say it's part of science, but it's
not part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in
our sense of "meta").</span>   <span class="s s234">The idea of evolution is another.</span> <span class="s s235">It turns
out to have quite broad applications&acirc;&#128;&#148;for example, in genetic
algorithms and even product design.</span>  <span class="s s236">Frankfurt's distinction between
lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example.</span><span class="s s237">

   <p>
    <span class="s s238">These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general
observations that would cause someone who understood them to do
something differently.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s240">Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely
defined.</span>  <span class="s s241">Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're
doing math.</span>  <span class="s s242">So starting from utility won't entirely solve the
problem I described above&acirc;&#128;&#148;it won't flush out the metaphysical
singularity.</span>  <span class="s s243">But it should help.</span>  <span class="s s244">It gives people with good
intentions a new roadmap into abstraction.</span>  <span class="s s245">And they may thereby
produce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentions
look bad by comparison.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s247">One drawback of this approach is that it won't produce the sort of
writing that gets you tenure.</span>  <span class="s s248">And not just because it's not currently
the fashion.</span>  <span class="s s249">In order to get tenure in any field you must not
arrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree
with.</span>  <span class="s s250">In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.</span>
<span class="s s251">In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at
any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything
false ("6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment").</span>
<span class="s s252">In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions
(e.</span><span class="s s253">g.</span> <span class="s s254">conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusions
so narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s256">The kind of philosophy I'm advocating won't be able to take either
of these routes.</span>  <span class="s s257">At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's
standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.</span>
<span class="s s258">And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without
implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.</span>  <span class="s s259">Worse
still, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy
people: there's no use in telling people things they already believe,
and people are often upset to be told things they don't.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s261">Here's the exciting thing, though.</span>  <span class="s s262">Anyone can do this.</span>  <span class="s s263">Getting
to general plus useful by starting with useful and cranking up the
generality may be unsuitable for junior professors trying to get
tenure, but it's better for everyone else, including professors who
already have it.</span>  <span class="s s264">This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope.</span>
<span class="s s265">You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific,
and then gradually make them more general.</span>  <span class="s s266">Joe's has good burritos.</span>
<span class="s s267">What makes a good burrito?</span>  <span class="s s268">What makes good food?</span>  <span class="s s269">What makes
anything good?</span>  <span class="s s270">You can take as long as you want.</span>  <span class="s s271">You don't have
to get all the way to the top of the mountain.</span>  <span class="s s272">You don't have to
tell anyone you're doing philosophy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s274">If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here's an
encouraging thought.</span>  <span class="s s275">The field is a lot younger than it seems.
Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about
2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500
years old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners
weren't doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or
Aristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading
army.</span>  <span class="s s276">In the times when they weren't, philosophy was hopelessly
intermingled with religion.</span>  <span class="s s277">It didn't shake itself free till a
couple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by the
structural problems I've described above.</span>  <span class="s s278">If I say this, some will
say it's a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization,
and others will say it's old news, but here goes: judging from their
works, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their
time.</span>  <span class="s s279">So in a sense the field is still at the first step.</span><span class="s s280">
                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                [

preposterous in 10,000 years.</span>  <span class="s s283">Civilization always seems old, because
it's always the oldest it's ever been.</span>  <span class="s s284">The only way to say whether
something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence,
and structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the
unexpected breakdown of words.</span>

In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite
some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize
a small percentage of statements.  We may never do that much better,
for the same reason 1980s-style "knowledge representation" could
never have worked; many statements may have no representation more

Wittgenstein asserted a sort of mastery to which the inhabitants
of early 20th century Cambridge seem to have been peculiarly
vulnerable&acirc;&#128;&#148;perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious
and then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads
for someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal
Newman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge
in that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as
European politics then had no natural immunity to dictators.</span>

Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that
philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any
particular truths you'll learn.</span>  <span class="s s360">The philosophers whose works they
cover would be rolling in their graves at that.</span>  <span class="s s361">They hoped they
were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped
they were getting results.</span>  <span class="s s362">Most were wrong, but it doesn't seem
an impossible hope.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s364">This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack
of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process.</span>
<span class="s s365">No, they were going about it wrong.</span>  <span class="s s366">It turns out it is possible
to transmute lead into gold (though not economically at current
energy prices), but the route to that knowledge was to
backtrack and try another approach.</span>
