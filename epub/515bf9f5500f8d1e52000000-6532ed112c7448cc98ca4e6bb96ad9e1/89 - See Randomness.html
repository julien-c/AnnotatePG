  <p>
   <span class="s s3">Plato quotes Socrates as saying "the unexamined life is not worth
living.</span><span class="s s4">"</span>  <span class="s s5">Part of what he meant was that the proper role of humans is to
think, just as the proper role of anteaters is to poke their noses
into anthills.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">A lot of ancient philosophy had the quality&mdash;and I
don't mean this in an insulting way&mdash;of the kind of conversations
freshmen have late at night in common rooms:</span>
   </p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s8">What is our purpose?</span>  <span class="s s9">Well, we humans are
as conspicuously different from other animals as the anteater.</span>
<span class="s s10">In our case the distinguishing feature is the ability to reason.</span>
<span class="s s11">So obviously that is what we should be doing, and a human who
doesn't is doing a bad job of being human&mdash;is no better than an
animal.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s13">
   Now we'd give a different answer.  At least, someone Socrates's age
would.  We'd ask why we even suppose we have a "purpose" in life.
We may be better adapted for some things than others; we
may be happier doing things we're adapted for; but why assume
purpose?
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s14">The history of ideas
is a history of gradually discarding the assumption that it's all
about us.</span>  <span class="s s15">No, it turns out, the earth is not the center of the
universe&mdash;not even the center of the solar system.</span>  <span class="s s16">No, it turns
out, humans are not created by God in his own image; they're just
one species among many, descended not merely from apes, but from
microorganisms.  Even the concept of "me" turns out to be fuzzy
around the edges if you examine it closely.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s18">The idea that we're the center of things is difficult to discard.</span>
<span class="s s19">So difficult that there's probably room to discard more.</span><span class="s s20">  Richard
Dawkins made another step in that direction only in the last several
decades, with the idea of the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">
    selfish gene
   </a>
   .</span>   
<span class="s s21">No, it turns
out, we're not even the protagonists: we're just the latest model
vehicle our genes have constructed to travel around in.</span>  <span class="s s22">And having
kids is our genes heading for the lifeboats.</span>  <span class="s s23">Reading
that book snapped my brain out of its previous way of thinking the
way Darwin's must have when it first appeared.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s25">
   (Few people can experience now what Darwin's contemporaries did
when
   <i>
    The Origin of Species
   </i>
   was first published, because everyone
now is raised either to take evolution for granted, or to regard
it as a heresy.</span> <span class="s s26">No one encounters the idea of natural selection for
the first time as an adult.</span><span class="s s27">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">So if you want to discover things that have been overlooked till
now, one really good place to look is in our blind spot: in our
natural, naive belief that it's all about us.</span>  <span class="s s29">And expect to encounter
ferocious opposition if you do.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s31">
   Conversely, if you have to choose between two theories, prefer the
one that doesn't center on you.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s32">This principle isn't only for big ideas.</span>  <span class="s s33">It works in everyday life,
too.</span>  <span class="s s34">For example, suppose you're saving a piece of cake in the fridge, and you
come home one day to find your housemate has eaten
it.</span>  <span class="s s35">Two possible theories:</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s36">
    a) Your housemate did it deliberately to upset you.  He
    <i>
     knew
    </i>
    you were saving that piece of cake.
   </span></blockquote>
  
  <p>
   <span class="s s37">b) Your housemate was hungry.</span>
   <span class="s s38">I say pick b.</span>  <span class="s s39">No one knows who said "never attribute to malice what
can be explained by incompetence," but it is a powerful idea.</span>
<span class="s s40">Its more general version is our answer to the Greeks:</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s41">
    Don't see purpose where there isn't.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s42">
   Or better still, the positive version:
   </span><blockquote><span class="s s43">
    See randomness.
   </span></blockquote>
