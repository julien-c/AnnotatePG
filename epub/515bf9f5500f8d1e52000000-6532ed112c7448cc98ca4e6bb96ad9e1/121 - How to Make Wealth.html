    <span class="s s4">If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it?</span> <span class="s s5">I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup.</span>  <span class="s s6">That's been a 
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.</span>  <span class="s s7">The word "startup" 
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is 
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
"high-tech startup" is almost redundant.</span>  <span class="s s10">A startup is a small
company that takes on a hard technical problem.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that.</span>
<span class="s s13">You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher.</span>  <span class="s s14">But
I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.</span>
<span class="s s15">Why do startups have to be small?</span>  
<span class="s s16">Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it
grows larger?</span>  
<span class="s s17">And why do they so often work on
developing new technology?</span>   <span class="s s18">Why are there so many startups
selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil
or laundry detergent?</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s20">
    The Proposition
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to 
compress your whole working life into a few years.</span>  <span class="s s22">Instead
of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as
hard as you possibly can for four.</span>  <span class="s s23">This pays especially well
in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.</span>  <span class="s s26">If you're
a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can
get a job paying about $80,000 per year.</span>  <span class="s s27">So on average 
such a hacker must be
able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the 
company just to break even.</span>  <span class="s s28">You could probably
work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if
you focus you can probably get three times as much done in
an hour.</span><span class="s s29">

                    You should get another multiple of two, at
least, by eliminating the drag 
of the pointy-haired middle
manager who would be your boss in a big company.</span>
<span class="s s30">Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you
than your job description expects you to be?</span>
<span class="s s31">Suppose another multiple of three.</span>  <span class="s s32">Combine all these multipliers, and I'm
claiming you could be 36 times more 
productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate
job.</span><span class="s s33">
                    
                     [
    <a name="f2" href="#f2n">

    </a>
    ]
                    
                    If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a 
big company, then a smart
hacker working very hard without any corporate
bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about
$3 million a year.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one
has a lot of wiggle room.</span>  <span class="s s36">I wouldn't try to
defend the actual numbers.</span>  <span class="s s37">But I stand by the 
structure of the calculation.</span>  <span class="s s38">I'm not claiming
the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more
than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s40">If $3 million a year seems
high, remember that we're talking about the limit case:
the case where you not only have zero leisure time
but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s42">Startups are not magic.</span>  <span class="s s43">They don't change the laws of
wealth creation.</span>  <span class="s s44">They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.</span>
<span class="s s45">There is a conservation law at work here: if
you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a 
million dollars' worth of pain.</span>  
<span class="s s46">For example, one way to
make a million dollars would be to work for the 
Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your 
salary.</span>  <span class="s s47">Imagine the stress of working for the Post 
Office for fifty years.</span>   <span class="s s48">In a startup you compress all
this stress into three or four years.</span>  <span class="s s49">You do tend to get a 
certain 
bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,
but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law.</span>
<span class="s s50">If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s52">
    Millions, not Billions
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s53">If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem
low to others.</span><span class="s s54">  Three
    <i>
     million?
    </i>
    How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now.</span>  <span class="s s57">It's not
a good idea to use famous rich people 
as examples, because the press only 
write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.</span>
<span class="s s58">Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,
but you need more than
that to make as much money as he has.</span>  <span class="s s59">You also need to be
very lucky.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s61">There is a large random
factor in the success of any company.</span><span class="s s62">  So the guys you end 
up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very 
smart, totally dedicated,
    <i>
     and
    </i>
    win the lottery.</span>
<span class="s s63">Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also 
happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular
blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for
DOS.</span>  <span class="s s64">No doubt Bill did 
everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, 
and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if
there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side,
Microsoft's future would have been very different.</span>
<span class="s s65">Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.</span>
<span class="s s66">They were effectively a component supplier.</span>  <span class="s s67">If IBM had 
required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft
would still have signed the deal.</span>  <span class="s s68">It would still have
meant a lot of money for them,  and IBM
could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s70">Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market
to give Microsoft control of the PC standard.</span>  <span class="s s71">From 
that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.</span>  <span class="s s72">They
never had to bet the company on a bold decision.</span>  <span class="s s73">All they
had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more
innovative products reasonably promptly.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would
still have been a successful company, but it
could not have grown so big so fast.</span> 
<span class="s s76">Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere
near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">There are a lot of ways to get
rich, and this essay is about only one of them.</span>  <span class="s s79">This
essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and
getting paid for it.</span>  <span class="s s80">There are plenty of other ways to 
get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, 
theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,
graft, lobbying,
counterfeiting, and prospecting.</span>  <span class="s s81">Most of the greatest fortunes
have probably involved several of these.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s83">
    The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,
is not just that it's more legitimate 
(many of the other methods are now illegal) 
but that it's more
    <i>
     straightforward.
    </i>
    You just have to do something people want.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s85">
    Money Is Not Wealth
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s86">If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.</span>  
<span class="s s87">Wealth is not the same thing as money.</span><span class="s s88">
                                              
                                               [

    </a>
    ]
                                              
                                              Wealth is as old as
human history.</span>  <span class="s s89">Far older, in fact; ants have wealth.</span> 
<span class="s s90">Money is a comparatively recent invention.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">Wealth is the fundamental thing.</span>  <span class="s s93">Wealth is stuff we want: food, 
clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,
and so on.</span>  <span class="s s94">You can have wealth without
having money.</span>  <span class="s s95">If you had a magic machine that
could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your
laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money.</span>
<span class="s s96">Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is
nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s98">Wealth is what you want, not money.</span>  <span class="s s99">But if wealth is the important
thing, why does everyone talk about making money?</span>   <span class="s s100">It is
a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice
they are usually interchangeable.</span><span class="s s101">  But they are not the same thing,
and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about
    <i>
     making money
    </i>
    can make it harder to understand how to 
make money.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s103">Money is a side effect of specialization.</span>
<span class="s s104">In a specialized society, most of the
things you need, you can't make for yourself.</span>  <span class="s s105">If you want a potato
or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone
else.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s107">How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?</span>
<span class="s s108">By giving him something he wants in return.</span>  <span class="s s109">But you can't get
very far by trading things directly with the people who
need them.</span>  <span class="s s110">If you make violins, and none of the local
farmers wants one, how will you eat?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s112">The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to
make the trade into a two-step process.</span>  <span class="s s113">Instead of trading violins
directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, 
which you can then trade again for anything else you need.</span><span class="s s114">  The
intermediate stuff-- the
    <i>
     medium of exchange
    </i>
    -- can be anything that's
rare and portable.</span><span class="s s115">  Historically metals have been the most common,
but recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the
    <i>
     dollar
    </i>
    ,
that doesn't physically exist.</span>  <span class="s s116">It works as a medium of exchange,
however, because its rarity 
is guaranteed by the U.</span><span class="s s117">S.</span> <span class="s s118">Government.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s120">The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work.</span>
<span class="s s121">The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really
means.</span>  <span class="s s122">People think that what a business does is make money.</span>
<span class="s s123">But money is just the intermediate stage-- just
a shorthand-- for whatever people want.</span>
<span class="s s124">What most businesses really do is make  
wealth.</span>  <span class="s s125">They do something people want.</span><span class="s s126">

   <h3><span class="s s127">
    The Pie Fallacy
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s128">A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea
that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world.</span><span class="s s129"> 
There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of
    <i>
     money
    </i>
    at 
any moment.</span>  <span class="s s130">But that's not the same thing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s132">When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often
described as a pie.</span>  <span class="s s133">"You can't make the pie larger,"
say politicians.</span>
<span class="s s134">When you're
talking about the amount of money in one family's bank
account, or the amount available to a government from one
year's tax revenue, this is true.</span>  
<span class="s s135">If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s137">I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few
rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else.</span>
<span class="s s138">Many people seem to continue to believe something like this
well into adulthood.</span>  <span class="s s139">This fallacy is usually there in the 
background when you hear someone talking about how x percent
of the population have y percent of the wealth.</span>  <span class="s s140">If you plan
to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're
planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s142">What leads people astray here is the abstraction of
money.</span>  <span class="s s143">Money is not wealth.</span>  <span class="s s144">It's
just something we use to move wealth around.</span>
<span class="s s145">So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like
your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to
trade with other people for things you want,
there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.</span><span class="s s146">
    <i>
     You can make more wealth.
    </i>
    Wealth has been getting created and
destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s148">Suppose you own a beat-up old car.</span> 
<span class="s s149">Instead of sitting on your butt next
summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition.</span>
<span class="s s150">In doing so you create wealth.</span>  <span class="s s151">The world is-- and
you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer.</span>  <span class="s s152">And not
just in some metaphorical way.</span>  <span class="s s153">If you sell your car,
you'll get more for it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s155">In restoring your old car you have made yourself
richer.</span>  <span class="s s156">You haven't made anyone else poorer.</span>  <span class="s s157">So there is
obviously not a fixed pie.</span>  <span class="s s158">And in fact, when you look at 
it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.</span><span class="s s159">
                                                                        
                                                                         [

   <p>
    <span class="s s160">Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create
wealth.</span>  <span class="s s161">If you need to give someone a present and don't
have any money, you make one.</span>  <span class="s s162">But kids are so bad at making
things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct,
inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression
of the proverbial thought that counts.</span> 
<span class="s s163">And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays
we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s165">
    Craftsmen
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s166">The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be
created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.</span>
<span class="s s167">Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones.</span> 
<span class="s s168">But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and
fewer craftsmen.</span>  <span class="s s169">One of the biggest remaining groups  is
computer programmers.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s171">
    A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and
    <i>
     create wealth
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s172">A good piece of software is, in itself, 
a valuable thing.</span>
<span class="s s173">There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue.</span>  <span class="s s174">Those
characters you type 
are a complete, finished product.</span>
<span class="s s175">If someone sat down and wrote a web
browser that didn't suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world
would be that much richer.</span><span class="s s176">
                                                                                
                                                                                 [

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s177">Everyone in a company works together to create
wealth, in the sense of making more things people want.</span>
<span class="s s178">Many of the employees (e.</span><span class="s s179">g.</span> <span class="s s180">the people in the mailroom or
the personnel department) work at one remove from the 
actual making of stuff.</span>  <span class="s s181">Not the programmers.</span>  <span class="s s182">They
literally think the product, one line at a time.</span>
<span class="s s183">And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something
that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a
pie, by some imaginary Daddy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s185">It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations
in the rate at which wealth is created.</span>  <span class="s s186">At Viaweb we had one
programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity.</span>  
<span class="s s187">I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that
he had added several hundred thousand dollars
to the market value of the company.</span> 
<span class="s s188">A great programmer, on a roll, could 
create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.</span>
<span class="s s189">A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or
even negative wealth (e.</span><span class="s s190">g.</span> <span class="s s191">by introducing bugs).</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s193">This is
why so many of the best programmers are libertarians.</span>
<span class="s s194">In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses.</span><span class="s s195">
When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates,
reporters, politicians-- hear
that the richest 5% of the people have 
half the total wealth, they tend to think
    <i>
     injustice!
    </i>
    An experienced programmer would be more likely to think
    <i>
     is that all?
    </i>
    The top 5% of programmers
probably write 99% of the good software.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s197">Wealth can be created without being sold.</span>  <span class="s s198">Scientists, till
recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they 
created.</span>  <span class="s s199">We are all richer for knowing about penicillin,
because we're less likely to die from infections.</span>  <span class="s s200">Wealth
is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something
we want.</span>  <span class="s s201">Hackers often donate their work by 
writing open source software that anyone can use for free.</span>
<span class="s s202">I am much the richer for the operating system
FreeBSD, which I'm running on the computer I'm using now,
and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s204">
    What a Job Is
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s205">In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or
another at least until their twenties.</span>  <span class="s s206">After all those years you get
used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up
in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they
do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.</span>  <span class="s s207">Belonging to such a group becomes
part of your identity: name, age, role, institution.</span>
<span class="s s208">If you have to introduce yourself, or
someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John
Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or
John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.</span>
   </p>

    <span class="s s210">When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job.</span>  <span class="s s211">And
what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution.</span>
<span class="s s212">Superficially it's a lot like college.</span>  <span class="s s213">You pick the companies you
want to work for and apply to join them.</span>  <span class="s s214">If one likes you, you
become a member of this new group.</span>  <span class="s s215">You get up in the morning and
go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily,
enjoy doing.</span>  <span class="s s216">There are a few differences: life is not as much fun,
and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college.</span>  <span class="s s217">But
the similarities feel greater than the differences.</span>  <span class="s s218">John Smith is
now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s220">In fact John Smith's
life has changed more than he realizes.</span>  <span class="s s221">Socially, a company
looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the
underlying reality, the more different it gets.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s223">What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to
exist, is earn money.</span>  <span class="s s224">And the way most companies make money
is by creating wealth.</span>  <span class="s s225">Companies can be so specialized that this
similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing 
companies that create wealth.</span>  <span class="s s226">A big component of wealth is
location.</span> 
<span class="s s227">Remember that magic machine that could
make you cars and cook you dinner and so on?</span>  <span class="s s228">It would not be
so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location
in central Asia.</span>  
<span class="s s229">If wealth means what people want, companies that move
things also create wealth.</span>  <span class="s s230">Ditto for
many other kinds of companies that don't make anything
physical.</span>  <span class="s s231">Nearly all companies exist to do something people
want.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s233">And that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company.</span>
<span class="s s234">But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying
reality.</span>  <span class="s s235">In a company, the work you do is averaged together with
a lot of other people's.</span>  
<span class="s s236">You may not even be aware you're doing something people
want.</span>  <span class="s s237">Your contribution may be indirect.</span>  <span class="s s238">But the company as a
whole must be giving people something they want, or they won't make
any money.</span>  <span class="s s239">And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on
average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth
of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes,
and will go out of business.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s241">Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs
to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of 
an institution.</span>  <span class="s s242">A more direct way to put it would be: you need to
start doing something people want.</span>  <span class="s s243">You don't
need to
join a company to do that.</span>  <span class="s s244">All a company is is a group of people
working together to do something people want.</span>  <span class="s s245">It's doing something people
want that matters, not joining the group.</span><span class="s s246">

   <p>
    <span class="s s247">For most people the   
best plan probably is to go to work for some existing
company.</span>  <span class="s s248">But it is a good idea to understand what's happening   
when you do this.</span>  <span class="s s249">A job means doing something people want,
averaged together with everyone else in that company.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s251">
    Working Harder
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s252">That averaging gets to be a problem.</span>
<span class="s s253">I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the   
difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work.</span> 
<span class="s s254">For the most part they punt.</span>  <span class="s s255">In a
big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working 
fairly hard.</span>  <span class="s s256">You're expected not to be obviously incompetent or
lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole life to your
work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s258">It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your
life you devote to your work.</span>  <span class="s s259">In the right kind of business,  
someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or
even a hundred times as much wealth as an average
employee.</span>  <span class="s s260">A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along
maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write
a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of
revenue.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s262">Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this.</span> 
<span class="s s263">You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten
times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much?</span> <span class="s s264">For
one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as
hard as you can.</span>  <span class="s s265">But a more serious problem is that the company
has no way of measuring the value of your work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s267">Salesmen are an exception.</span>  <span class="s s268">It's easy 
to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're
usually paid a percentage of it.</span>  <span class="s s269">If a salesman wants to work harder,
he can just start doing it, and he will automatically
get paid proportionally more.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s271">There is one other job besides sales where big companies can
hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs.</span> 
<span class="s s272">And for the same reason: their performance can
be measured.</span>  <span class="s s273">The top managers are
held responsible for the performance of the entire company.</span>
<span class="s s274">Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually
be measured, he is not expected to do
more than put in a solid effort.</span>  <span class="s s275">Whereas top management, like
salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.</span>
<span class="s s276">The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in  
a solid effort.</span>  <span class="s s277">If the company does badly, he's done badly.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s279">A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly   
would be enormously successful.</span>  <span class="s s280">Many employees would work harder
if they could get paid for it.</span>  <span class="s s281">More importantly,
such a company would attract people who wanted to work
especially hard.</span> 
<span class="s s282">It would crush its competitors.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s284">Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen.</span>  <span class="s s285">Salesmen
work alone.</span>  <span class="s s286">Most employees' work is tangled together.</span>  <span class="s s287">Suppose
a company makes some kind of consumer gadget.</span>  <span class="s s288">The 
engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features;
the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then
the marketing people convince everyone that
it's something they've got to have.</span>  <span class="s s289">How do you know how much of the
gadget's sales are due to each group's efforts?</span>  <span class="s s290">Or, for that
matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave
the company a reputation for quality?</span>  <span class="s s291">There's no way to  
untangle all their contributions.</span>  <span class="s s292">Even if you could read the minds
of the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred together.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s294">If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work
tangled together with a large number of other people's.</span>  <span class="s s295">In a  
large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and 
the rest of the group slows you down.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s297">
    Measurement and Leverage
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s298">To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two
things, measurement and leverage.</span>  <span class="s s299">You need to be in a
position where your performance can be measured, or there is
no way to get paid more by doing more.</span>  <span class="s s300">And you have to
have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have   
a big effect.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s302">Measurement alone is not enough.</span>  <span class="s s303">An example of a job with
measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a
sweatshop.</span>  <span class="s s304">Your performance is measured and you get paid  
accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions.</span>  <span class="s s305">The only
decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that
can probably only increase your earnings by a factor
of two or three.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s307">An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would
be lead actor in a movie.</span>  <span class="s s308">Your performance can be measured in the
gross of the movie.</span>  <span class="s s309">And you have leverage in the sense that your
performance can make or break it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s311">CEOs also have both measurement and leverage.</span>  <span class="s s312">They're measured,
in that the performance of the company is their performance.</span>
<span class="s s313">And they have leverage in that their decisions
set the whole company moving in one direction or another.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s315">I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be
found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.</span>    
<span class="s s316">Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, 
hedge fund managers, professional athletes.</span>  <span class="s s317">A good hint to the
presence of leverage is the possibility of failure.</span>
<span class="s s318">Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is 
big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying
possibility of loss.</span>  <span class="s s319">CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes
all live with the sword hanging over their heads;
the moment they start to suck, they're out.</span>  <span class="s s320">If you're in
a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich,
because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s322">But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to
be in a situation with measurement and leverage.</span>  <span class="s s323">All you        
need to do is be part of a small group working on a
hard problem.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s325">
    Smallness = Measurement
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s326">If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual  
employees, you can get close.</span>  <span class="s s327">You can measure the value
of the work done by small groups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s329">One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue
generated by employees is at the level of the whole company.</span>   
<span class="s s330">When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to 
measuring the contributions of individual employees.</span>  <span class="s s331">A viable
startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a
factor of ten of measuring individual effort.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s333">Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most
people can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times
as hard, so please pay me ten times as much.</span>  <span class="s s334">There are two
differences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the
customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and
you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group
of other ambitious people.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s336">It will, ordinarily, be a group.</span>  <span class="s s337">Except in a few unusual kinds
of work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company 
of one person.</span>  
<span class="s s338">And the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that
yours is going to be averaged with.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s340">A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers.</span>
<span class="s s341">Two things keep the speed of the
galley down.</span>  <span class="s s342">One is that individual rowers don't see any
result from working harder.</span> 
<span class="s s343">The other is that, in a group of a
thousand people, the average rower is likely  to be
pretty average.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s345">If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and
put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go  
faster.</span>  <span class="s s346">They would have both carrot and stick to motivate   
them.</span>  <span class="s s347">An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought
that he could have a visible effect on the speed of
the boat.</span>  <span class="s s348">And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely
to notice and complain.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s350">
    But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when 
you take the ten
    <i>
     best
    </i>
    rowers out of the big galley
and put them in a boat together.</span>  <span class="s s351">They will have all
the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.</span>
<span class="s s352">But more importantly, by selecting that small a group
you can get the best rowers.</span>  <span class="s s353">Each one will be in
the top 1%.</span>  <span class="s s354">It's a much better deal for them to average  
their work together with a small group of their peers than to    
average it with everyone.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s356">That's the real point of startups.</span>  <span class="s s357">Ideally, you are getting
together with a group of other people who also want to work
a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in
a big company.</span>  <span class="s s358">And because startups tend to get founded 
by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already 
know one another (at least by reputation), the level of 
measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone.</span>
<span class="s s359">A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s361">Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup
depends on the first ten employees.</span>  <span class="s s362">I agree.</span> <span class="s s363">If 
anything, it's more like the first five.</span>
<span class="s s364">Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,   
but rather that small groups can be select.</span>
<span class="s s365">You don't want small in the sense of a
village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s367">The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average
for the population as a whole.</span>   <span class="s s368">So all other things being
equal, a very able person in a big company is probably
getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by
the overall lower performance of the others.</span>  <span class="s s369">Of course,
all other things often are not equal: the able person may 
not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large
company.</span>  <span class="s s370">But a very able person who does care about money
will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small
group of peers.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s372">
    Technology = Leverage
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s373">Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with
measurement and leverage.</span>
<span class="s s374">They allow measurement because they're small,
and they offer leverage because they
make money by inventing new technology.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s376">What is technology?</span><span class="s s377">  It's
    <i>
     technique
    </i>
    .</span> <span class="s s378">It's the way  
we all do things.</span>  <span class="s s379">And when
you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied
by all the people who use it.</span>  <span class="s s380">It is the proverbial fishing
rod, rather than the fish.</span>  <span class="s s381">That's the difference between a
startup and a restaurant or a barber shop.</span>  <span class="s s382">You fry eggs or cut 
hair one customer at a time.</span>  <span class="s s383">Whereas if 
you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about,
you help everyone who uses your solution.</span>  
<span class="s s384">That's leverage.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s386">If you look at history, it seems that most people
who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing
new technology.</span>  <span class="s s387">You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.</span>
<span class="s s388">What made the Florentines rich in 1200 
was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech 
product of the time, fine woven cloth.</span>  <span class="s s389">What made the
Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and
navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas
of the Far East.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s391">Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and
solving hard problems.  The leading edge of technology moves
fast.</span>  <span class="s s392">Technology that's valuable today could be worthless
in a couple years.</span>  <span class="s s393">Small companies are more at home in this
world, because they don't have layers of bureaucracy to
slow them down.</span>
<span class="s s394">Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches,
and small companies are less constrained by convention.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s396">Big companies can develop technology.</span>  <span class="s s397">They just can't do it
quickly.</span>  <span class="s s398">Their size makes them slow and prevents
them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary
effort required.</span>  <span class="s s399">So in practice big companies only get to develop 
technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from
competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, 
or passenger aircraft.</span>  <span class="s s400">And even in those fields they depend heavily
on startups for components and ideas.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s402">It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve
hard technical problems, but 
I think it will also be found to be true 
in businesses that don't seem to be about technology.</span>  <span class="s s403">McDonald's,
for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's 
franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the 
face of the earth.</span>  <span class="s s404">A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules
so precise that it is practically
a piece of software.</span>  <span class="s s405">Write once, run everywhere.</span>
<span class="s s406">Ditto for Wal-Mart.</span>  <span class="s s407">Sam Walton got rich not by being a 
retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s409">Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall
aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way.</span><span class="s s410">
At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was
    <i>
     run upstairs.
    </i>
    Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big,
fat, bully.</span>  <span class="s s411">You open a door and find yourself in a    
staircase.</span>  <span class="s s412">Do you go up or down?</span>  <span class="s s413">I say up.</span>  <span class="s s414">The
bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can.</span>
<span class="s s415">Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.</span>
<span class="s s416">Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s418">What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought      
hard problems.  If there were two features we could add to our
software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty,
we'd always take the harder one.</span><span class="s s419">  Not just because it was 
more valuable, but
    <i>
     because it was harder.
    </i>
    We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors
to follow us over difficult ground.</span>
<span class="s s420">Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the
mountains, where the troops of the central government
can't follow.</span>  <span class="s s421">I can remember times when we were just
exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical
problem.</span>  <span class="s s422">And I'd be delighted, because something that was 
hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s424">This is not just a good way to run a startup.</span>  <span class="s s425">It's what

your technology would be hard to duplicate.</span>  <span class="s s429">Otherwise as

   <h3><span class="s s447">
    The Catch(es)
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s448">If it were simply a matter of working harder than 
an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would
obviously be a good deal to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s449">Up to a point it
would be more fun.</span> <span class="s s450">I don't think many people 
like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings,
the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers,
and so on.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s452">Unfortunately there are a couple catches.</span>  <span class="s s453">One is that you
can't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit.</span>
<span class="s s454">You can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just
two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more.</span>  <span class="s s455">When
you're running a startup, your competitors decide how
hard you work.</span>  <span class="s s456">And they pretty much all make the same decision:
as hard as you possibly can.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s458">The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate
to your productivity.</span>  <span class="s s459">There is, as I said before, a large
random multiplier in the success of any company.</span>  <span class="s s460">So in
practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get 
paid 30 times as much.</span>  <span class="s s461">It is that you're 30 times as productive,
and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.</span>
<span class="s s462">If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero.</span>
<span class="s s463">Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood 
portals we all heard about during
the Internet Bubble.</span>  <span class="s s464">It's common for a startup
to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly
too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s466">A startup is like a mosquito.</span>  <span class="s s467">A bear can absorb a hit and a crab
is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing:
to score.</span>  <span class="s s468">No energy is wasted on defense.</span>  <span class="s s469">The defense of mosquitos, 
as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little 
consolation to the individual mosquito.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s471">Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.</span>
<span class="s s472">And you don't generally know which of the two you're going to
get till the last minute.</span> 
<span class="s s473">Viaweb came close to tanking several times.</span> <span class="s s474">Our trajectory
was like a sine wave.</span>  <span class="s s475">Fortunately we got bought at
the top of the cycle, but it was damned close.</span>   <span class="s s476">While we were
visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company
to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure
an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding 
that we needed to stay alive.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s478">The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted.</span>
<span class="s s479">Viaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse.</span>
<span class="s s480">If there had been some way just to work super hard and get
paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have
been delighted.</span>  <span class="s s481">We would have much preferred a 100% chance of
$1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though 
theoretically the second is worth twice as much.</span>   <span class="s s482">Unfortunately,
there is not currently any space in the business world where
you can get the first deal.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s484">The closest you can get is by
selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside  
(and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff.</span>  <span class="s s485">We had a 
chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by.</span>
<span class="s s486">After that we became comically eager to sell.</span>
<span class="s s487">For the next year or so,
if anyone expressed the slightest curiousity about Viaweb
we would try to sell them the company.</span>  <span class="s s488">But there were no takers,
so we had to keep going.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s490">It would have been a bargain to 
buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not
looking for bargains.</span>  <span class="s s491">A company big enough to acquire 
startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and 
within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will
be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be
business school types who joined the company late.</span>  
<span class="s s492">They would rather overpay for a safe choice.</span>  <span class="s s493">So
it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large
premium, than an early-stage one.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s495">
    Get Users
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s496">I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can.</span>  <span class="s s497">Running a
business is different from growing one.</span>
<span class="s s498">It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach 
cruising altitude.</span>  <span class="s s499">It's
also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.</span>
<span class="s s500">What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his
client's assets into one volatile stock?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s502">How do you get bought?</span>  <span class="s s503">Mostly by doing the same things 
you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company.</span>  <span class="s s504">Being 
profitable, for example.</span>   <span class="s s505">But getting bought is also an art
in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying
to master.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s507">Potential buyers will
always delay if they can.</span>  <span class="s s508">The hard part about getting
bought is getting them to act.</span>  <span class="s s509">For most people, the most powerful motivator
is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.</span>  <span class="s s510">For potential
acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that 
one of their competitors will buy you.</span>  <span class="s s511">This, as we found, 
causes CEOs to take red-eyes.</span>  
<span class="s s512">The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you 
now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to
acquire later, or even become a competitor.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s514">In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.</span>  
<span class="s s515">You'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of
research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology
was.</span>  <span class="s s516">Not at all.</span>  <span class="s s517">What they go by is the number of users you
have.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s519">In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the
best technology.</span>  <span class="s s520">And this is not as stupid as it sounds.</span>  <span class="s s521">Users 
are the only real proof that you've created wealth.</span>  <span class="s s522">Wealth is 
what people want, and if people aren't using your software,
maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing.</span>  <span class="s s523">Maybe it's
because you haven't made what they want.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s525">Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for.</span>
<span class="s s526">Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are 
obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead
of making users happy.</span><span class="s s527">  In a startup, you're not just trying to
solve problems.  You're trying to solve problems
    <i>
     that 
users care about.
    </i>
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s528">So I think you should make users the test, just as 
acquirers do.</span>  <span class="s s529">Treat a startup as an optimization problem 
in which performance is measured by number of users.</span>  <span class="s s530">As anyone
who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement.</span>
<span class="s s531">When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would
make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s533">Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will 
be very close.</span>  <span class="s s534">It's what acquirers care about.</span>  <span class="s s535">It's what 
revenues depend on.</span>  
<span class="s s536">It's what makes competitors unhappy.</span>
<span class="s s537">It's what impresses reporters, and potential
new users.</span>  <span class="s s538">Certainly it's a better test than your a priori
notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how
technically adept you are.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s540">Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization
problem will help you avoid another
pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long time
to develop a product.</span>  <span class="s s541">Now we can recognize this as something
hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization.</span>  <span class="s s542">Get a version 
1.</span><span class="s s543">0 out there as soon as you can.</span>  <span class="s s544">Until you have some users to
measure, you're optimizing based on guesses.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s546">The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying
principle that wealth is what people want.</span>  <span class="s s547">If you plan to get 
rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.</span>  
<span class="s s548">So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.</span>
<span class="s s549">How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the
phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind?</span>
<span class="s s550">When you hear "your call is important to us, please stay on
the line," do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s552">A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner.</span>
<span class="s s553">But in technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone
eats.</span>  <span class="s s554">So any difference between what people want and what
you deliver is multiplied.</span>  
<span class="s s555">You please or annoy
customers wholesale.</span>  <span class="s s556">The closer you can get to what they want,
the more wealth you generate.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s558">
    Wealth and Power
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s559">Making wealth is not the only way to get rich.</span>  <span class="s s560">For most of
human history it has not even been the most common.</span>  <span class="s s561">Until
a few centuries ago,
the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,
land, and cattle,
and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance,
marriage, conquest, or confiscation.</span>  
<span class="s s562">Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s564">Two things changed.</span>  <span class="s s565">The first was the rule of law.</span>  <span class="s s566">For most of the world's
history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his 
henchmen 
would find a way to steal it.</span>
<span class="s s567">But in medieval Europe something new happened.</span>
<span class="s s568">A new class of merchants and manufacturers
began to collect in towns.</span><span class="s s569">

that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet
Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor
governments of the 1960s and early 1970s.</span>  <span class="s s576">Take away the incentive
of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s578">Remember what a startup is, economically: 
a way of saying, I want to work faster.</span>  <span class="s s579">Instead of accumulating
money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I 
want to get it over with as soon as possible.</span>  <span class="s s580">So governments
that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing
that you work slowly.</span>  <span class="s s581">They're willing to let you earn $3 million over
fifty years, but they're not willing to let you work so hard that
you can do it in two.</span>  <span class="s s582">They are like
the corporate boss that you can't go to and say, I want to work
ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much.</span>
<span class="s s583">Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own
company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s585">The problem with working slowly is not just that technical
innovation happens slowly.</span>  <span class="s s586">It's that it tends not to happen at all.</span>
<span class="s s587">It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems,
as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take
on this kind of project.</span>  <span class="s s588">Developing new technology is a 
pain in the ass.</span> <span class="s s589">It is, as Edison said, one percent 
inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.</span>  
<span class="s s590">Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it.</span>
<span class="s s591">Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon
rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies
like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s593">Startups
are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in 
the last couple decades.</span>  <span class="s s594">Since it became possible to
get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has
used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage,
where measurement comes from working with a small
group, and leverage from developing new techniques.</span>
<span class="s s595">The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is 
in Santa Clara today.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s597">Understanding this may help to answer an important question:
why Europe grew so powerful.</span>
<span class="s s598">Was it something about the geography of 
Europe?</span>  <span class="s s599">Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior?</span>
<span class="s s600">Was it their religion?</span>  <span class="s s601">The answer (or at least
the proximate cause) may be that the
Europeans 
rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who
made a lot of money to keep it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s603">Once you're allowed to do that, 
people who want to get rich can do it by generating
wealth instead of stealing it.</span>
<span class="s s604">The resulting technological growth translates not only 
into wealth but into military power.</span>  <span class="s s605">The theory that led to
the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician.</span>
<span class="s s606">But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry,
it remained for them a theory;
they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations
fast enough to design an actual airplane.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s608">In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as
World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history.</span>
<span class="s s609">Don't let a ruling
class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs.</span>
<span class="s s610">The same recipe that makes individuals rich
makes countries powerful.</span>  <span class="s s611">Let the nerds keep their lunch
money, and you rule the world.</span>

One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is
    <i>
     uninterruptability
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s615">Different kinds of
work have different time quanta.</span>  <span class="s s616">Someone proofreading a
manuscript
could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes
with little loss of productivity.</span>  <span class="s s617">But the time quantum for
hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load
a problem into your head.</span>  <span class="s s618">So the
cost of having someone from personnel
call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s620">This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they
turn from their screen to answer your question.</span>  <span class="s s621">Inside
their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s623">The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers
from starting hard projects.</span>  <span class="s s624">This is why they
tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible
to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s626">One great advantage of startups is that they don't yet have
any of the people who interrupt you.</span>  <span class="s s627">There is no personnel
department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.</span>

Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be
20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies,
executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could
I get the people working for me to do that?</span>  <span class="s s630">The answer is
simple: pay them to.</span>

Until recently even governments sometimes didn't grasp the
distinction between money and wealth.</span><span class="s s635">  Adam
Smith (
    <i>
     Wealth of Nations
    </i>
    , v:i) mentions several
that tried to preserve their
"wealth" by forbidding the export of gold or silver.</span>
<span class="s s636">But having more of the medium of exchange would not make
a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same
amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.</span>

There are many senses of the word "wealth," not all of
them material.</span>  <span class="s s639">I'm not trying to make a deep philosophical
point here about which
is the true kind.</span>  <span class="s s640">I'm writing about one specific,
rather technical sense of the word "wealth.</span><span class="s s641">"</span>  <span class="s s642">What
people will give you money for.</span>
<span class="s s643">This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because
it is the kind that prevents you from starving.</span>
<span class="s s644">And what people will give you money for depends on them,
not you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s646">When you're starting a business,
it's easy to slide into thinking that customers
want what you do.</span>  <span class="s s647">During the Internet Bubble I talked
to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was
starting an "outdoor portal.</span><span class="s s648">"</span> <span class="s s649">You know what
kind of business you should start if you like
the outdoors?</span>  <span class="s s650">One to recover data from crashed hard disks.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s652">What's the connection?</span>  <span class="s s653">None at all.</span>  <span class="s s654">Which is precisely my point.</span>
<span class="s s655">If you want
to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not
starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any
plan that centers on things you like doing.</span>
<span class="s s656">That is where your idea of what's valuable is least
likely to coincide with other people's.</span>

In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone
else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to
the environment.</span>  <span class="s s659">While environmental costs should be taken
into account, they don't
make wealth a zero-sum game.</span>  <span class="s s660">For example, if you repair
a machine that's broken because a part has come unscrewed,
you create wealth with no environmental cost.</span>

Few technologies have one clear inventor.</span>  <span class="s s677">So as
a rule, if you know the "inventor" of something
(the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, 
the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their
company made money from it, and the company's PR people worked
hard to spread the story.</span>  <span class="s s678">If you don't know who invented
something (the automobile, the television, the computer,
the jet engine, the laser), it's because other companies

It may indeed be a sufficient condition.</span>  <span class="s s691">But if so, why didn't
