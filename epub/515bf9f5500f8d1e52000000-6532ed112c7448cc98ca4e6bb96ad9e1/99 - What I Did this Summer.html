    What I Did this Summer
   </span></h1>
   </h2><p><span class="s s2">
    October 2005
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.</span>  <span class="s s4">We were
surprised how well it went.</span>  <span class="s s5">Overall only about 10% of startups   
succeed, but if I had to guess now, I'd predict three or four of  
the eight startups we funded will make it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s7">Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have
either closed a round or are likely to soon.</span>  <span class="s s8">Two have already
turned down (lowball) acquisition offers.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s10">
    We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising
by the end of the summer.  What's going on?  Did some kind of anomaly
make this summer's applicants especially good?  We worry about that,
but we can't think of one.  We'll find out this

     winter
              .
    </span></xa></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">The whole summer was full of surprises.</span><span class="s s13">  The best was that the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html">
     hypothesis
    </a>
    we were testing seems to be
correct.</span>  <span class="s s14">Young hackers can start viable companies.</span>  <span class="s s15">This is good
news for two reasons: (a) it's an encouraging thought, and (b) it 
means that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is not
hosed.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s17">
    Age
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s18">More precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends
mainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how old
you are or how much business experience you have.</span>  <span class="s s19">The results so
far bear this out.</span>  <span class="s s20">The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18  
to 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their ages
and how well they're doing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s22">This should not really be surprising.</span> <span class="s s23">Bill Gates and Michael Dell 
were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous.</span>
<span class="s s24">Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soon
as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s26">Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less
money than most people think.</span>  <span class="s s27">Other investors were surprised to
hear the most we gave any group was $20,000.</span>  <span class="s s28">But we knew it was
possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on
$10,000.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">And so it proved this summer.</span>  <span class="s s31">Three months' funding is enough to
get into second gear.</span>  <span class="s s32">We had a demo day for potential investors
ten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready
by that time.</span><span class="s s33">  One,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://reddit.com">
     Reddit
    </a>
    , had
already launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they 
had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard.</span>  <span class="s s36">People
this age are commonly seen as lazy.</span>  <span class="s s37">I think in some cases it's not
so much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the work
they're offered is unappetizing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s39">The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people
do real work, they work hard, whatever their age.</span>  <span class="s s40">As one of the
founders said "I'd read that starting a startup consumed your life,  
but I had no idea what that meant until I did it.</span><span class="s s41">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s43">I'd feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard.</span>  <span class="s s44">But
we're not these people's bosses.</span>  <span class="s s45">They're working on their own
projects.</span>  <span class="s s46">And what makes them work is not us but their competitors.</span>
<span class="s s47">Like good athletes, they don't work hard because the coach yells
at them, but because they want to win.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s49">We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder  
than employees.</span>  <span class="s s50">It seems like a win for everyone.</span>  <span class="s s51">The only catch
is that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while an
employer gets nearly all of it.</span>  <span class="s s52">(We're counting on it being 5-7%
of a much larger number.</span><span class="s s53">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily
responsible.</span>  <span class="s s55">I can't think of a time when one failed to do something
they'd promised to, even by being late for an appointment.</span>  <span class="s s56">This
is another lesson the world has yet to learn.</span>  <span class="s s57">One of the founders
discovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with
executives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company
to rent him a car, because he was too young.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent
laziness of people this age.</span>  <span class="s s60">They seem lazy because the work they're
given is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they're not
given any power.</span>  <span class="s s61">Some of them, anyway.</span>  <span class="s s62">We only have a sample size
of about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in their
early twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s64">
    Morale
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s65">The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic.</span>  <span class="s s66">They also  
wanted very much to get rich.</span>  <span class="s s67">These qualities might seem incompatible,
but they're not.</span>  <span class="s s68">These guys want to get rich, but they want to do
it by changing the world.</span>  <span class="s s69">They wouldn't (well, seven of the eight
groups wouldn't) be interested in making money by speculating in
stocks.</span>  <span class="s s70">They want to make something people use.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s72">I think this makes them more effective as founders.</span>  <span class="s s73">As hard as  
people will work for money, they'll work harder for a cause.</span>  <span class="s s74">And   
since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the
paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money
are those who aren't in it just for the money.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s76">
    The founders of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://kiko.com">
     Kiko
    </a>
    , for example,   
are working on an Ajax calendar.</span>  <span class="s s77">They want to get rich, but they
pay more attention to design than they would if that were their
only motivation.</span>  <span class="s s78">You can tell just by looking at it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s80">I never considered it till this summer, but this might be another
reason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by
MBAs.</span>  <span class="s s81">Perhaps it's not just that hackers understand technology
better, but that they're driven by more powerful motivations.</span>
<span class="s s82">Microsoft, as I've said before, is a dangerously misleading example.</span>  
<span class="s s83">Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies.</span>   
<span class="s s84">Google is a better model.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s86">Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean,
we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors.</span>
<span class="s s87">But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we
started Viaweb.</span>  <span class="s s88">For the first year, our initial reaction to news 
of a competitor was always: we're doomed.</span>  <span class="s s89">Just as a hypochondriac
magnifies his symptoms till he's convinced he has some terrible
disease, when you're not used to competitors you magnify them into
monsters.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s91">Here's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous
as they seem.</span>  <span class="s s92">Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them.</span>
<span class="s s93">And it certainly doesn't matter how many of them there are, any
more than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners
are behind him.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s95">
    "It's a crowded market," I remember one founder saying worriedly.
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s96">
    "Are you the current leader?" I asked.
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s97">
    "Yes."
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s98">
    "Is anyone able to develop software faster than you?"
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s99">
    "Probably not."
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s100">"Well, if you're ahead now, and you're the fastest, then you'll
stay ahead.</span>  <span class="s s101">What difference does it make how many others there
are?</span><span class="s s102">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s104">Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewrite
their software from scratch.</span>  <span class="s s105">I told them it would be a bad sign
if they didn't.</span>  <span class="s s106">The main function of your initial version is to  
be rewritten.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s108">That's why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability,
internationalization, and heavy-duty security at first.</span> <span class="s s109">[1] I can
imagine an advocate of "best practices" saying these ought to be
considered from the start.</span>  <span class="s s110">And he'd be right, except that they
interfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to  
be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.</span>  <span class="s s111">Having to
retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly.</span>  
<span class="s s112">The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version
was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s114">I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies.</span>
<span class="s s115">Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light
enough to evolve.</span>  <span class="s s116">In big companies, all the pressure is in the   
direction of over-engineering.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s118">
    What Got Learned
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s119">One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups  
would need help.</span>  <span class="s s120">That turned out to vary a lot.</span>  <span class="s s121">Some we helped
with technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an application
to run on multiple servers.</span>  <span class="s s122">Most we helped with strategy questions,
like what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away.</span>
<span class="s s123">Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how  
much money should they take and what kind of terms should they
expect?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s125">However, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like
patents and investors.</span>  <span class="s s126">These problems aren't intrinsically difficult,
just unfamiliar.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s128">It was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast they
learned.</span>  <span class="s s129">The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a  
practice session where all the groups gave their presentations.</span>  
<span class="s s130">They were all terrible.</span>  <span class="s s131">We tried to explain how to make them better,
but we didn't have much hope.</span>  <span class="s s132">So on demo day I told the assembled
angels and VCs that these guys were hackers, not MBAs, and so while
their software was good, we should not expect slick presentations 
from them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s134">The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations.</span> 
<span class="s s135">Gone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features.</span>   <span class="s s136">It was
as if they'd spent the past week at acting school.</span>  <span class="s s137">I still don't 
know how they did it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s139">Perhaps watching each others' presentations helped them see what
they'd been doing wrong.</span>  <span class="s s140">Just as happens in college, the summer   
founders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more than they
learned from us.</span>  <span class="s s141">A lot of the problems they face are the same,  
from dealing with investors to hacking Javascript.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s143">
    I don't want to give the impression there were no problems this  
summer.  A lot went wrong, as usually happens with startups.  One
group got an "
    </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000024.html"><span class="s s144">
     exploding
term-sheet
    </span></a><span class="s s145">
    " from some VCs.  Pretty much all the groups who had
dealings with big companies found that big companies do everything
infinitely slowly.  (This is to be expected.  If big companies
weren't incapable, there would be no room for startups to exist.)
And of course there were the usual nightmares associated with
servers.
    </span><!-- When Kiko's server went down after they got slashdotted,
the guy in charge of the server was in China and had to fix it from
there. -->
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s146">In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood
diseases.</span>  <span class="s s147">Some of this summer's eight startups will   
probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight 
succeeded.</span>  <span class="s s148">But what kills them will not be dramatic, external    
threats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s150">So far, though, the news is all good.</span>  <span class="s s151">In fact, we were surprised
how much fun the summer was for us.</span>  <span class="s s152">The main reason was how much
we liked the founders.</span>  <span class="s s153">They're so earnest and hard-working.</span>  <span class="s s154">They
seem to like us too.</span>  <span class="s s155">And this illustrates another advantage of
investing over hiring: our relationship with them is way better   
than it would be between a boss and an employee.</span>  <span class="s s156">Y Combinator ends
up being more like an older brother than a parent.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s158">I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions.</span>
<span class="s s159">Fortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to
someone, I could usually get to the right person by at most one
hop.</span>  <span class="s s160">I remember wondering, how did my friends get to be so eminent?</span>
<span class="s s161">and a second later realizing: shit, I'm forty.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s163">Another surprise was that the three-month batch format,
which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turned
out to be an advantage.</span>  <span class="s s164">When we started Y Combinator, we planned
to invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in,     
we'd evaluate them and decide yes or no.</span>  <span class="s s165">The SFP
was just an experiment to get things started.</span><span class="s s166">  But it worked so
well that we plan to do
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/funding.html">
     all
    </a>
    our investing this way, one cycle in
the summer and one in winter.</span>  <span class="s s167">It's more efficient for us, and
better for the startups too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s169">Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common
problem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no social
life.</span>  <span class="s s170">(I remember that part all too well.</span><span class="s s171">)  This way, they were
guaranteed a social event at least once a week.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s173">
    Independence
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s174">I've heard Y Combinator described as an "incubator.</span><span class="s s175">"</span>  <span class="s s176">Actually we're
the opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and
we make a point of exerting less.</span>  <span class="s s177">Among other things, incubators
usually make you work in their office-- that's where the 
word "incubator" comes from.</span>  <span class="s s178">That seems the wrong model.</span>  <span class="s s179">If
investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful 
forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s181">Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble.</span>  <span class="s s182">There's  
still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because
they're a bad idea.</span>  <span class="s s183">My vote is they're a bad idea.</span>  <span class="s s184">I think they 
fail because they select for the wrong people.</span>  <span class="s s185">When we were starting
a startup, we would never have taken funding from an "incubator.</span><span class="s s186">"</span>
<span class="s s187">We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.</span>  <span class="s s188">And  
people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s190">Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit
of independence.</span>  <span class="s s191">I've been wondering about that.</span>  <span class="s s192">Are some people
just a lot more independent than others, or would everyone be this
way if they were allowed to?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s194">As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: some
of each.</span>  <span class="s s195">But my main conclusion from the summer is that there's
more environment in the mix than most people realize.</span><span class="s s196">  I could see
that from how the founders' attitudes
    <i>
     changed
    </i>
    during the   
summer.</span>  <span class="s s197">Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told
what to do.</span>  <span class="s s198">They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom.</span>
<span class="s s199">But they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seem
about four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at the
beginning of the summer.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s201">When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most about
starting a company, one said "the most shocking thing is that it 
worked.</span><span class="s s202">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s204">It will take more experience to know for sure, but my guess is that
a lot of hackers could do this-- that if you put people in a position
of independence, they develop the qualities they need.</span>  <span class="s s205">Throw them
off a cliff, and most will find on the way down that they have   
wings.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s207">The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work in
the other direction too.</span><span class="s s208"> Most hackers are 
employees, and this
    <a target="_blank" href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">
     molds
    </a>
    you into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible as
surely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handle
it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s210">If I'm right, "hacker" will mean something different in twenty years
than it does now.</span> <span class="s s211">Increasingly it will mean the people who run the
company.</span>  <span class="s s212">Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would
have happened anyway.</span>  <span class="s s213">Power is shifting from the people who deal
with money to the people who create technology, and if our experience
this summer is any guide, this will be a good thing.</span>
