   The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn

    (This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">The startups we've funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem
quicker to learn some lessons than others.</span>  <span class="s s5">I think it's because
some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s7">
   We've now
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">
    invested
   </a>
   in enough companies that I've learned a trick
for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones:
they're the ones I have to keep repeating.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s9">So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups
I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding.</span><span class="s s10"> I'll make them
all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll
just be able to say:
   <i>
    number four!
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <h3><span class="s s11">
   1. Release Early.
  </span></h3>
  <p><span class="s s12">
   The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get
a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">By "release early" I don't mean you should release something full
of bugs, but that you should release something minimal.</span>  <span class="s s14">Users hate
bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's
more coming soon.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s16">There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.</span>  <span class="s s17">One
is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for
a startup or not.</span>  <span class="s s18">I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to
contradict it.</span>  <span class="s s19">I've seen a lot of startups die because they were
too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.</span><span class="s s20">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">One of the things that will surprise you if you build something
popular is that you won't know your users.</span><span class="s s22">
   <a target="_blank" href="http://reddit.com">
    Reddit
   </a>
   now has almost half a million
unique visitors a month.</span>  <span class="s s23">Who are all those people?</span>  <span class="s s24">They have no
idea.</span>  <span class="s s25">No web startup does.</span>  <span class="s s26">And since you don't know your users,
it's dangerous to guess what they'll like.</span>  <span class="s s27">Better to release
something and let them tell you.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s29">
   <a target="_blank" href="http://wufoo.com">
    Wufoo
   </a>
   took this to heart and released
their form-builder before the underlying database.</span>  <span class="s s30">You can't even
drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's
seat and hold the steering wheel.</span>  <span class="s s31">And Wufoo got valuable feedback
from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they
rewrote their software not to.</span>  <span class="s s32">If they'd waited to release everything
at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was
more deeply wired in.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s34">Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release
quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown
cruise.</span>  <span class="s s35">If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good,
for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting
that first version out will expose it.</span>  <span class="s s36">And if you have such problems
you want to find them early.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s38">Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that
it makes you work harder.</span>  <span class="s s39">When you're working on something that
isn't released, problems are intriguing.</span>  <span class="s s40">In something that's out
there, problems are alarming.</span>  <span class="s s41">There is a lot more urgency once you
release.</span>  <span class="s s42">And I think that's precisely why people put it off.</span>  <span class="s s43">They
know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do.</span><span class="s s44">

  <h3><span class="s s45">
   2. Keep Pumping Out Features.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">Of course, "release early" has a second component, without which
it would be bad advice.</span>  <span class="s s47">If you're going to start with something
that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s49">What I find myself repeating is "pump out features.</span><span class="s s50">"</span>  <span class="s s51">And this rule
isn't just for the initial stages.</span>  <span class="s s52">This is something all startups
should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s54">I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever
more complex.</span>  <span class="s s55">By "feature" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum
of making users' lives better.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s57">As with exercise, improvements beget improvements.</span>  <span class="s s58">If you run every
day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow.</span>  <span class="s s59">But if you skip
running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself
out.</span>  <span class="s s60">So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more
ideas you'll have.</span>  <span class="s s61">You should make your system better at least in
some small way every day or two.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s63">This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a
form of marketing.</span>  <span class="s s64">Users love a site that's constantly improving.</span>
<span class="s s65">In fact, users expect a site to improve.</span>  <span class="s s66">Imagine if you visited a
site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and
not one thing had changed.</span>  <span class="s s67">Wouldn't it start to seem lame?</span><span class="s s68">
                                         
                                          [
   <a name="f3" href="#f3n">
    3
   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their
comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.</span>
<span class="s s70">If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens--
you'll generate fanatical loyalty.</span>  <span class="s s71">You won't need to advertise,
because your users will do it for you.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s73">This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?</span>  <span class="s s74">I
think the problem here is that people get used to how things are.</span>
<span class="s s75">Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you
start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens
to have become its identity.</span>  <span class="s s76">For example, I doubt many people at
Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail
could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s78">I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far
short of what it could be.</span>  <span class="s s79">Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual
exercise, to keep thinking of improvements.</span>  <span class="s s80">Ok, sure, what you
have is perfect.</span>  <span class="s s81">But if you had to change something, what would
it be?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s83">If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations:
(a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.</span>  <span class="s s84">Experience suggests
(b) is a thousand times more likely.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s86">
   3. Make Users Happy.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make
users happy.</span>  <span class="s s88">One thing all startups have in common is that they
can't force anyone to do anything.</span>  <span class="s s89">They can't force anyone to use
their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them.</span>
<span class="s s90">A startup has to sing for its supper.</span>  <span class="s s91">That's why the successful
ones make great things.</span>  <span class="s s92">They have to, or die.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s94">When you're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris
blown about by powerful winds.</span>  <span class="s s95">The most powerful wind is users.</span>
<span class="s s96">They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did
with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with
most startups.</span>  <span class="s s97">Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any
other.</span>  <span class="s s98">If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s100">As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is
not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will
catch.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s102">I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the
stream of traffic is.</span>  <span class="s s103">The vast majority of people who visit your
site will be casual visitors.</span>  <span class="s s104">It's them you have to design your
site for.</span>  <span class="s s105">The people who really care will find what they want by
themselves.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s107">The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back
button.</span>  <span class="s s108">Think about your own experience: most links you
follow lead to something lame.</span><span class="s s109">  Anyone who has used the web for
more than a couple weeks has been
   <i>
    trained
   </i>
   to click on Back after
following a link.</span>  <span class="s s110">So your site has to say "Wait!</span>  <span class="s s111">Don't click on
Back.</span>  <span class="s s112">This site isn't lame.</span>  <span class="s s113">Look at this, for example.</span><span class="s s114">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s116">There are two things you have to do to make people pause.</span>  <span class="s s117">The most
important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell
your site is about.</span>  <span class="s s118">How often have you visited a site that seemed
to assume you already knew what they did?</span><span class="s s119">  For example, the corporate
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.interwoven.com/company/">
    site
   </a>
   that says the
company makes
   </span></p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s120">enterprise content management solutions for business that enable
  organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize
  business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total
  cost of ownership.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s122">
   An established company may get away with such an opaque description,
but no startup can.  A startup
should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it
does.
                                                               
                                                                [
   </span><a name="f4" href="#f4n"><span class="s s123">
    4
   </span></a><span class="s s124">
   ]
                                                               
                                                               And not just to users.  You need this for everyone:
investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and
even current employees.  You probably shouldn't even start a company
to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two
sentences.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s125">The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got,
right away.</span>  <span class="s s126">If you have something impressive, try to put it on the
front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see.</span>
<span class="s s127">Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good
stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore
further.</span><span class="s s128">
                                                                 
                                                                  [
   <a name="f5" href="#f5n">
    5
   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p><span class="s s129">
   In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell
visitors what your site is about by
   <i>
    showing
   </i>
   them.</span>  <span class="s s130">One of the
standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is "show, don't tell.</span><span class="s s131">"</span>
<span class="s s132">Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or
break his pencil in half.</span>  <span class="s s133">Nothing will explain what your site does
so well as using it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s135">The industry term here is "conversion.</span><span class="s s136">"</span>  <span class="s s137">The job of your site is
to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition
of a user is.</span>  <span class="s s138">You can measure this in your growth rate.</span>  <span class="s s139">Either
your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you must know which.</span>  <span class="s s140">If
you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure
you are now.</span>  <span class="s s141">And if you don't, you need to fix something.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s143">
   4. Fear the Right Things.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s144">Another thing I find myself saying a lot is "don't worry.</span><span class="s s145">"</span>  <span class="s s146">Actually,
it's more often "don't worry about this; worry about that instead.</span><span class="s s147">"</span>
<span class="s s148">Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong
things.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s150">Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.</span>  <span class="s s151">Disasters
are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent
that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run
into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name,
a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.</span>  <span class="s s152">They won't
kill you unless you let them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s154">Nor will most competitors.</span>  <span class="s s155">A lot of startups worry "what if Google
builds something like us?</span><span class="s s156">"</span>  <span class="s s157">Actually big companies are not the ones
you have to worry about-- not even Google.</span>  <span class="s s158">The people at Google
are smart, but no smarter than you; they're not as motivated, because
Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails;
and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s160">What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players,
but other startups you don't know exist yet.</span>  <span class="s s161">They're way more
dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s163">Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of
security.</span><span class="s s164">  You should compete against what someone else
   <i>
    could
   </i>
   be
doing, not just what you can see people doing.</span>  <span class="s s165">A corollary is that
you shouldn't relax just because you have no visible competitors
yet.</span>  <span class="s s166">No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there
working on the same thing.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s168">That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people
are doing it.</span>  <span class="s s169">But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that
makes this a bad time to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s170">More people are starting
startups, but not as many more as could.</span>  <span class="s s171">Most college graduates
still think they have to get a job.</span>  <span class="s s172">The average person can't ignore
something that's been beaten into their head since they were three
just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s174">And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat.</span>  <span class="s s175">Way more
startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors.</span>  <span class="s s176">There
are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal
disputes, inertia, and ignoring users.</span>  <span class="s s177">Each is, by itself, enough
to kill you.</span>  <span class="s s178">But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring
users.</span>  <span class="s s179">If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die,
here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know
everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build,
no matter what.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s181">Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.</span>  <span class="s s182">If companies stuck to
their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages,
and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.</span>  <span class="s s183">In both cases
their customers told them what their business should be-- and they
were smart enough to listen.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s185">As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than
the imagination of man.</span>  <span class="s s186">You'll find more interesting things by
looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.</span>
<span class="s s187">This principle is very powerful.</span>  <span class="s s188">It's why the best abstract painting
still falls short of Leonardo, for example.</span>  <span class="s s189">And it applies to
startups too.</span>  <span class="s s190">No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the
ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam
of users.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s192">
   5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s193">I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what
the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it's not
what you might think.</span>  <span class="s s194">The most important quality in a startup
founder is determination.</span>  <span class="s s195">Not intelligence-- determination.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s197">This is a little depressing.</span>  <span class="s s198">I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded
because we were smart, not merely determined.</span>  <span class="s s199">A lot of people in
the startup world want to believe that.</span>  <span class="s s200">Not just founders, but
investors too.</span>  <span class="s s201">They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by
intelligence.</span>  <span class="s s202">And you can tell they really believe this, because
it affects their investment decisions.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s204">Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors.</span>
<span class="s s205">This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize
existing research, but in software you want to invest in students,
not professors.</span>  <span class="s s206">Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by
people who dropped out of school to do it.</span>  <span class="s s207">What students lack in
experience they more than make up in dedication.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s209">Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be
determined.</span>  <span class="s s210">You have to be smart too, right?</span>  <span class="s s211">I'd like to think
so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent
several years living in New York.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s213">You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill
you.</span>  <span class="s s214">But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and
that will kill you very rapidly.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s216">Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but
it requires extraordinary effort.</span>  <span class="s s217">If an ordinary employee were
asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very
indignant.</span>  <span class="s s218">Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in
addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had
to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer
the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the
company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s220">And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big
company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters.</span>  <span class="s s221">That's the
part that really demands determination.</span>  <span class="s s222">In a startup, there's
always some disaster happening.</span>  <span class="s s223">So if you're the least bit inclined
to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s225">But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting
you long before you actually quit.</span>  <span class="s s226">Everyone who deals with startups
knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent,
they won't give you much attention.</span>  <span class="s s227">If you lack commitment, you'll
just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to
your competitors but not to you.</span>  <span class="s s228">If you lack commitment, it will
seem to you that you're unlucky.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s230">Whereas if you're determined to stick around, people will pay
attention to you, because odds are they'll have to deal with you
later.</span>  <span class="s s231">You're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come
to terms with you.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s233">At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the
attitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for
three months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with
it-- "something great" meaning either that someone wants to buy
them or invest millions of dollars in them.</span>  <span class="s s234">But if this is your
attitude, "something great" is very unlikely to happen to you,
because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of
commitment.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s236">If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what,
they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you
stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and
they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.</span>  <span class="s s237">Ditto for
investors.</span>  <span class="s s238">What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not
the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out.</span><span class="s s239">

   6. There Is Always Room.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s250">I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might
be good to add a social component to their software.</span>  <span class="s s251">He said he
didn't think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out.</span>
<span class="s s252">Really?</span>  <span class="s s253">So in a hundred years the only social networking sites
will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.</span><span class="s s254">icio.</span><span class="s s255">us?</span>  <span class="s s256">Not likely.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s258">There is always room for new stuff.</span>  <span class="s s259">At every point in history,
even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering
things that made everyone say "why didn't anyone think of that
before?</span><span class="s s260">"</span>  <span class="s s261">We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the
Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did
think of that.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s263">The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we
adjust to however things are, and assume that's how things have to
be.</span>  <span class="s s264">For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make
a better search engine than Google.</span>  <span class="s s265">Surely that field, at least,
is tapped out.</span>  <span class="s s266">Really?</span>  <span class="s s267">In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are
people still going to search for information using something like
the current Google?</span>  <span class="s s268">Even Google probably doesn't think that.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s270">In particular, I don't think there's any limit to the number of
startups.</span>  <span class="s s271">Sometimes you hear people saying "All these guys starting
startups now are going to be disappointed.</span> <span class="s s272">How many little startups
are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?</span><span class="s s273">"</span> <span class="s s274">That sounds cleverly
skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s275">No one proposes that
there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in
an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple
thousand people each.</span>  <span class="s s276">Why should there be any limit to the number
who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each?</span>
<span class="s s277">It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who
want to work that hard.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s279">The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get
acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should
be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the
amount of wealth that can be created.</span>  <span class="s s280">And I don't think there's
any limit on that, except cosmological ones.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s282">So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of
startups.</span>  <span class="s s283">Startups make wealth, which means they make things people
want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want,
we are nowhere near it.</span>  <span class="s s284">I still don't even have a flying car.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s286">
   7. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.
  </span></h3>
  <p><span class="s s287">
   This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator.
It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s288">Startup founders are naturally optimistic.</span>  <span class="s s289">They wouldn't do it
otherwise.</span>  <span class="s s290">But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat
the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also
very dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s291">You have to build a shield around it, or it will
fry you.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s293">The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be
useless if it were.</span>  <span class="s s294">It's pierced in a few places to let pipes in.</span>
<span class="s s295">An optimism shield has to be pierced too.</span>  <span class="s s296">I think the place to
draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you
expect of other people.</span>  <span class="s s297">It's ok to be optimistic about what you
can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s299">This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to
be pushing the limits of whatever you're doing.</span>  <span class="s s300">So things don't
happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the
world.</span>  <span class="s s301">Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s303">Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals.</span>
<span class="s s304">If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to
happen.</span>  <span class="s s305">The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't.</span>
<span class="s s306">The company that says they're going to buy you isn't.</span>  <span class="s s307">The big
customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't.</span>
<span class="s s308">Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s310">
   The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save
them from being
   <i>
    disappointed
   </i>
   when things fall through.</span>  <span class="s s311">It's
for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their
company against something that's going to fall over, taking them
with it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s313">For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a
natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.</span><span class="s s314">  That's why
people proposing deals seem so positive: they
   <i>
    want
   </i>
   you to
stop looking.</span>  <span class="s s315">And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a
pain.</span>  <span class="s s316">Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink.</span>  <span class="s s317">So you
have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s319">Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage
to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  Deals are
dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest,
there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's
done.</span> <span class="s s320">There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared
up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- if
they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw
you in the details.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s322">VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators.</span>  <span class="s s323">They're trained
to take advantage of weakness.</span><span class="s s324">
                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                        [

                                                                                                                                                       So while they're often nice
guys, they just can't help it.</span>  <span class="s s325">And as pros they do this more than
you.</span>  <span class="s s326">So don't even try to bluff them.</span>  <span class="s s327">The only way a startup can
have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.</span>  <span class="s s328">And if
you don't believe in a deal, you'll be less likely to depend on it.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s330">
   So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you
hear someone say the words "we want to invest in you" or "we want
to acquire you," I want the following phrase to appear automatically
in your head:
   <i>
    don't get your hopes up.
   </i>
   Just continue running
your company as if this deal didn't exist.</span>  <span class="s s331">Nothing is more likely
to make it close.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s333">The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting
lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors
and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s335">
   Speed, not Money
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s336">The way I've described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful.</span>
<span class="s s337">It is.</span>  <span class="s s338">When I talk to the founders of the companies we've funded,
they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn't
realize it would be this hard.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s340">So why do it?</span>  <span class="s s341">It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress
to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money?</span>  <span class="s s342">Is making
money really that important?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s344">No, not really.</span>  <span class="s s345">It seems ridiculous to me when people take business
too seriously.</span>  <span class="s s346">I regard making money as a boring errand to be got
out of the way as soon as possible.</span>  <span class="s s347">There is nothing grand or
heroic about starting a startup per se.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s349">So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?</span>  <span class="s s350">I'll tell
you why.</span>  <span class="s s351">Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get
rich, but as a way to work faster.</span>  <span class="s s352">You have to make a living, and
a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it
drag on through your whole life.</span><span class="s s353">

invent gods to explain it.</span>  <span class="s s358">But even to people who don't believe

A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application
