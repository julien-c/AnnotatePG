   If Lisp is So Great
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">

  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it?</span>  <span class="s s4">I was    
asked this question by a student in the audience at a 
talk I gave recently.</span>  <span class="s s5">Not for the first time, either.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">In languages, as in so many things, there's not much     
correlation between popularity and quality.</span><span class="s s8">  Why does   
John Grisham (
   <i>
    King of Torts
   </i>
   sales rank, 44) outsell
Jane Austen (
   <i>
    Pride and Prejudice
   </i>
   sales rank, 6191)?</span>
<span class="s s9">Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better
writer?</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s11">
   Here's the first sentence of
   <i>
    Pride and Prejudice:
   </i>
   </span></p><blockquote><span class="s s12">
    It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man 
in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
wife.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s13">
   "It is a truth universally acknowledged?"  Long words for
the first sentence of a love story.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s14">Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard.</span><span class="s s15">  Its syntax, or lack
of syntax, makes it look completely
   <a target="_blank" href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl2.lisp">
    unlike
   </a>
   the languages
most people are used to.</span>  <span class="s s16">Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid
of it too.</span>  <span class="s s17">I recently came across a notebook from 1983
in which I'd written:</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s18">
    I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s19">
   Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning
new things.  I was so ignorant that learning
almost anything meant learning new things.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s20">People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not
using it.</span>  <span class="s s21">The standard
excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp
was too slow.</span><span class="s s22">  Now that Lisp dialects are among
the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=nestedloop&amp;lang=all&amp;sort=cpu">
    faster
   </a>
   languages available, that excuse has gone away.</span>
<span class="s s23">Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages
are more popular.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s25">
   (Beware of such reasoning.  It gets you Windows.)
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it's especially
so in programming languages.</span> <span class="s s27">More libraries
get written for popular languages, which makes them still
more popular.</span>  <span class="s s28">Programs often have to work with existing programs,
and this is easier if they're written in the same language,
so languages spread from program to program like a virus.</span>
<span class="s s29">And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them 
more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s31">Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent,
there would be little justification for using any but the most
popular.</span><span class="s s32">  But they
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/icad.html">
    aren't
   </a>
   all equivalent, not by a long
shot.</span>  <span class="s s33">And that's why less popular languages, like Jane Austen's 
novels, continue to survive at all.</span>  <span class="s s34">When everyone else is reading 
the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people 
reading Jane Austen instead.</span>
