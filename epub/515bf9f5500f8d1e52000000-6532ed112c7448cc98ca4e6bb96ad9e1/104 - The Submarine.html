   <span class="s s22">Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back?</span><span class="s s23">  Because

   them to.</span>  <span class="s s24">One of the most surprising things I discovered
during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry,
lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news.</span>  <span class="s s25">Of the
stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics,
crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">I know because I spent years hunting such "press hits.</span><span class="s s27">"</span>  <span class="s s28">Our startup spent
its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling
our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000
a month.</span>  <span class="s s29">And they were worth it.</span>  <span class="s s30">PR is the news equivalent of
search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers
ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories.</span><span class="s s31">

   <a target="_blank" href="http://schwartz-pr.com/client_coverage.php"><span class="s s32">
    Our PR firm
   </span></a><span class="s s33">
   was one of the best in the business.  In 18 months, they got press
hits in over 60 different publications.
   </span><!-- They made us into stars. --><span class="s s34">
   And we weren't the only ones they did great things for.  
In 1997 I got a call from another
startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  I
told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous   
fees.  But I remember thinking his company's name was odd.
Why call an auction site "eBay"?

  <h3><span class="s s35">
   Symbiosis
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s36">PR is not dishonest.</span>  <span class="s s37">Not quite.</span>  <span class="s s38">In fact, the reason the best PR
firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest.</span>
<span class="s s39">They give reporters genuinely valuable information.</span>  <span class="s s40">A good PR firm
won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've
worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they
don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s42">If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters.</span>  <span class="s s43">The main reason PR  
firms exist is that reporters are lazy.</span>  <span class="s s44">Or, to put it more nicely,
overworked.</span>  <span class="s s45">Really they ought to be out there digging up stories
for themselves.</span>  <span class="s s46">But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and
let PR firms bring the stories to them.</span>  <span class="s s47">After all, they know good
PR firms won't lie to them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s49">A good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths
(what a nice color your eyes are).</span> <span class="s s50">Good PR firms use the same
strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth
favors their clients.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web  
let small merchants compete with big ones.</span>  <span class="s s53">This was perfectly true.</span>
<span class="s s54">But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this
particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants
were our target market, and we were paying the piper.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s56">Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms.
At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of
their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for
free if advertisers would let them.</span><span class="s s57">
                           
                            [
   <a href="#f2n" name="f2">
    2
   </a>
   ]
                           
                           The average
trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough
articles to make it look like a magazine.</span>  <span class="s s58">They're so desperate for
"content" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim,
if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s60">
   At the other extreme are publications like the
   <i>
    New York Times
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   .</span>  <span class="s s61">Their reporters do go out and
find their own stories, at least some of the time.</span>  <span class="s s62">They'll listen 
to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically.</span><span class="s s63">  We managed to get press   
hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed 
to crack the print edition of the
   <i>
    Times
   </i>
   .</span><span class="s s64">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s65">The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity.</span>
<span class="s s66">You don't pitch stories to them.</span>  <span class="s s67">You have to approach them as if
you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it
seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought 
of themselves.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one.</span>  <span class="s s70">We estimated, based on
some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the
Web.</span>  <span class="s s71">We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral   
enough.</span>  <span class="s s72">But once this "fact" was out there in print, we could quote
it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20%
of the online store market.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s74">This was roughly true.</span>  <span class="s s75">We really did have the biggest share of the
online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size.</span>  <span class="s s76">But
the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s78">Reporters like definitive statements.</span>  <span class="s s79">For example, many of the
stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the
10 worst spammers.</span>  <span class="s s80">This "fact" originated in Spamhaus's ROKSO list,
which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top
spammers.</span>  <span class="s s81">The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but
now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment.</span><span class="s s82">

   <a href="#f4n" name="f4">

   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s83">All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly
big spammer.</span>  <span class="s s84">But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like
"fairly big.</span><span class="s s85">"</span>  <span class="s s86">They want statements with punch, like "top ten.</span><span class="s s87">"</span> <span class="s s88">And
PR firms give them what they want.</span><span class="s s89">

  <h3><span class="s s91">
   Buzz
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s92">Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in
the generation of "buzz.</span><span class="s s93">"</span>  <span class="s s94">They usually feed the same story to    
several different publications at once.</span>  <span class="s s95">And when readers see similar
stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend
afoot.</span>  <span class="s s96">Which is exactly what they're supposed to think.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s98">When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores
at midnight to buy the first copies.</span>  <span class="s s99">None of them would have been
there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in
the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain
reaction.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s101">
   I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to  
track them at work.  If you search for the obvious phrases, you
turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the  
return of the suit.  For example, the Reuters article
   </span><!-- by Elizabeth Lazarowitz --><span class="s s102">
   that got picked up by
   </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-09-01-suits_x.htm"><span class="s s103">

   in September 2004.  "The suit is back," it begins.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s105">Trend articles like this are almost always the work of
PR firms.  Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to
figure out who the client is.</span>  <span class="s s106">With trend stories, PR firms usually
line up one or more "experts" to talk about the industry generally.</span> 
<span class="s s107">In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of
GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.</span><span class="s s108">

                                                 When
you get to the end of the experts, look for the client.</span> <span class="s s109">And bingo, 
there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment 
running ads saying "The Suit is Back.</span><span class="s s112">"</span>  <span class="s s113">Talk about a successful
press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own
ad copy.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s115">The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch
is to realize that they all started from the same document back at
the PR firm.</span>  <span class="s s116">Search for a few key phrases and the names of the
clients and the experts, and you'll turn up other variants of this 
story.</span>

hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media
came from.</span>  <span class="s s132">I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn't
realize why.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s134">Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where
you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether
the author was telling the whole truth?</span><span class="s s135">  If you really want to be
a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step
further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth,
but
   <i>
    why he's writing about this subject at all.
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s136">Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler.</span>  <span class="s s137">Most people who
publish online write what they write for the simple reason that
they want to.</span><span class="s s138">  You
can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as
you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons,
though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust
bloggers more than
   <i>

  <p>
   <span class="s s140">I was talking recently to a friend who works for a

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s147">Why?</span> <span class="s s148">I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest.</span><span class="s s149">
Imagine how incongruous the
   <i>
    New York Times

   article about
suits would sound if you read it in a blog:
   </span></p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s150">The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,
  prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--
  is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s152">
   The problem
with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.
The whole tone is bogus.  This is the tone of someone writing down
to their audience.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s153">Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online
is authentic.</span>  <span class="s s154">It's not mystery meat cooked up
out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into 
molds of zippy
journalese.</span>  <span class="s s155">It's people writing what they think.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s157">I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial
most of the writing in the mainstream media was.</span><span class="s s158">  I'm not saying
I used to believe what I read in
   <i>
    Time
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Newsweek

school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as
guides to what ordinary people were being
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/say.html">
    told
   </a>
   to think than as  
sources of information.</span>  <span class="s s160">But I didn't realize till the last  
few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing
that way.</span>  <span class="s s161">I didn't realize you could write as candidly and
informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s163">Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the
change.</span>  <span class="s s164">The PR industry has too.</span><span class="s s165">
A hilarious
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prsa.org/_Publications/magazines/0802news1.asp">
    article
   </a>
   on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the   
matter:
   </span></p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s166">Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces
  for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they
  began blogging in the first place.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s168">
   PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers
like them.  And that means there may be a struggle ahead.  As
this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we
should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate.  
When I think   
how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional   
media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories
to bloggers, if they can figure out how.
