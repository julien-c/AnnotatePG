    <i>
     (This essay is derived from a talk at the 2008 Startup School.)
    </i>
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s4">About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the
phrase that became our motto: Make something people want.</span>  <span class="s s5">We've
learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still
the one I'd pick.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s7">Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the
business model, at least at first.</span>  <span class="s s8">Not because making money is
unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something
great.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s10">A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas
together, you get something surprising.</span>  <span class="s s11">Make something people want.</span>
<span class="s s12">Don't worry too much about making money.</span>  <span class="s s13">What you've got is a
description of a charity.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a
bug or a new discovery.</span>  <span class="s s16">Either businesses aren't supposed to be
like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one
or both of the principles we began with is false.</span>  <span class="s s17">Or we have a new
idea.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s19">
    I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred
to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.
   </span></p>
   <h3><span class="s s20">
    Examples
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">For example, Craigslist.</span>  <span class="s s22">It's not a charity, but they run it like
one.</span>  <span class="s s23">And they're astoundingly successful.</span>  <span class="s s24">When you scan down the
list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist
looks like a misprint.</span> <span class="s s25">Their revenues aren't as high as they could
be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s27">In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind
of their opponents.</span>  <span class="s s28">If you're upwind, you decide when and if to
engage the other ship.</span>  <span class="s s29">Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous
revenues.</span>  <span class="s s30">They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more,
but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to
force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times
as much on sales as on development.</span><span class="s s31">

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s32">I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist.</span>
<span class="s s33">They're a product of unusual circumstances.</span>  <span class="s s34">But they're a good
model for the early phases.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s36">Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning.</span> <span class="s s37">They didn't
have ads for over a year.</span>  <span class="s s38">At year 1, Google was indistinguishable
from a nonprofit.</span>  <span class="s s39">If a nonprofit or government organization had
started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit
of what they'd have produced.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s41">Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a
good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering.</span>
<span class="s s42">I wasn't thinking of it as a company.</span>  <span class="s s43">I just wanted to keep people
from getting spammed.</span>  <span class="s s44">But as I thought more about this project, I
realized it would probably have to be a company.</span>  <span class="s s45">It would cost
something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and
donations.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s47">That was a surprising realization.</span>  <span class="s s48">Companies often claim to be
benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely
benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s50">I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it.</span>  <span class="s s51">But if
someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now.</span>  <span class="s s52">There was a window
of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big
email services had terrible filters.</span>  <span class="s s53">If someone had launched a
new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s55">Notice the pattern here?</span>  <span class="s s56">From either direction we get to the same
spot.</span>  <span class="s s57">If you start from successful startups, you find they often
behaved like nonprofits.</span>  <span class="s s58">And if you start from ideas for nonprofits,
you find they'd often make good startups.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s60">
    Power
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s61">How wide is this territory?</span>  <span class="s s62">Would all good nonprofits be good
companies?</span>  <span class="s s63">Possibly not.</span>  <span class="s s64">What makes Google so valuable is that
their users have money.</span>  <span class="s s65">If you make people with money love you,
you can probably get some of it.</span>  <span class="s s66">But could you also base a successful
startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don't have money?</span>
<span class="s s67">Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an
unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s69">I'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be
surprised how far it would go.</span>  <span class="s s70">For example, people who apply to Y
Combinator don't generally have much money, and yet we can profit
by helping them, because with our help they could make money.</span>  <span class="s s71">Maybe
the situation is similar with malaria.</span>  <span class="s s72">Maybe an organization that
helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting
growth.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s74">I'm not proposing this is a serious idea.</span>  <span class="s s75">I don't know anything
about malaria.</span>  <span class="s s76">But I've been kicking ideas around long enough to
know when I come across a powerful one.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what
point you'd bet against it.</span>  <span class="s s79">The thought of betting against benevolence
is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically
impossible.</span>  <span class="s s80">You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these
are such powerful forces.</span><span class="s s81">
                                               
                                                [

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s82">For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied
to Internet startups.</span>  <span class="s s83">Obviously it worked for Google, but what
about Microsoft?</span>  <span class="s s84">Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent?</span>  <span class="s s85">But when I
think back to the beginning, they were.</span>  <span class="s s86">Compared to IBM they were
like Robin Hood.</span>  <span class="s s87">When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they
were going to make money selling hardware at high prices.</span>  <span class="s s88">But by
gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market
to any manufacturer.</span>  <span class="s s89">Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people
got to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them.</span>
<span class="s s90">It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">Microsoft isn't so benevolent now.</span>  <span class="s s93">Now when one thinks of what
Microsoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with
F.</span><span class="s s94">
                                                   
                                                    [
    <a name="f3" href="#f3n">
     3
    </a>
    ]
                                                   
                                                   And yet it doesn't seem to pay.</span>
<span class="s s95">Their stock price has been flat for years.</span>  <span class="s s96">Back when they were
Robin Hood, their stock price rose like Google's.</span>  <span class="s s97">Could there be
a connection?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s99">You can see how there would be.</span>  <span class="s s100">When you're small, you can't bully
customers, so you have to charm them.</span>  <span class="s s101">Whereas when you're big you
can maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it's easier
than satisfying them.</span>  <span class="s s102">You grow big by being nice, but you can stay
big by being mean.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s104">You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, and
then all your victims escape.</span>  <span class="s s105">So "Don't be evil" may be the most
valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turn
out to be an elixir of corporate youth.</span>  <span class="s s106">I'm sure they find it
constraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves them
from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and
IBM.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s108">The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other
company.</span>  <span class="s s109">Anyone can adopt "Don't be evil.</span><span class="s s110">"</span>  <span class="s s111">The catch is that
people will hold you to it.</span>  <span class="s s112">So I don't think you're going to see
record labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s114">
    Morale
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s115">There's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works.</span>  <span class="s s116">But how
does it work?</span>  <span class="s s117">One advantage of investing in a large number of
startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.</span>  <span class="s s118">From
what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:
it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them,
and above all, it helps them be decisive.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s120">Morale is tremendously important to a startup&mdash;so important
that morale alone is almost enough to determine success.</span>  <span class="s s121">Startups
are often described as emotional roller-coasters.</span> <span class="s s122">One minute you're
going to take over the world, and the next you're doomed.</span><span class="s s123">  The
problem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you
unhappy, but that it makes you
    <i>
     stop working
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s124">So the downhills
of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than
the uphills.</span>  <span class="s s125">If feeling you're going to succeed makes you work
harder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but if
feeling you're going to fail makes you stop working, that practically
guarantees you'll fail.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s127">Here's where benevolence comes in.</span>  <span class="s s128">If you feel you're really helping
people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup
is doomed.</span>  <span class="s s129">Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.</span>
<span class="s s130">The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them.</span>
<span class="s s131">So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day,
you've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi.</span>  <span class="s s132">You've made
something you need to take care of.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s134">Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really
low lows and survived.</span>  <span class="s s135">At one point they ran out of money and
everyone left.</span> <span class="s s136">Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there
was no one but him.</span>  <span class="s s137">What kept him going?</span>  <span class="s s138">Partly that users needed
him.</span>  <span class="s s139">He was hosting thousands of people's blogs.</span> <span class="s s140">He couldn't just
let the site die.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s142">There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important
may be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in.</span>
<span class="s s143">Once you have users to take care of, you're forced to figure out
what will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable
information.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s145">The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can
also help you with investors.</span><span class="s s146"> One of the founders of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://chatterous.com">
     Chatterous
    </a>
    told 
me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service
was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working
on it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live
in their parents' basements.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s148">Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought
about them.</span>  <span class="s s149">They still met with them, but they weren't going to
die if they didn't get their money.</span>  <span class="s s150">And you know what?</span>  <span class="s s151">The investors
got a lot more interested.</span>  <span class="s s152">They could sense that the Chatterouses
were going to do this startup with or without them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s154">If you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you
become very hard to kill.</span>  <span class="s s155">And practically all startups, even the
most successful, come close to death at some point.</span>  <span class="s s156">So if doing
good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder
to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by
not choosing a more selfish project.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s158">
    Help
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s159">
    Another advantage of being good is that it makes other people want
to help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s160">
    One of the startups we've funded,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://octopart.com">
     Octopart
    </a>
    , is currently locked in
a classic battle of good versus evil.</span>  <span class="s s161">They're a search site for
industrial components.</span>  <span class="s s162">A lot of people need to search for components,
and before Octopart there was no good way to do it.</span>  <span class="s s163">That, it turned
out, was no coincidence.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s165">Octopart built the right way to search for components.</span>  <span class="s s166">Users like
it and they've been growing rapidly.</span>  <span class="s s167">And yet for most of Octopart's
life, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force
them take their prices off the site.</span>  <span class="s s168">Octopart is sending them
customers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic
stop.</span>  <span class="s s169">Why?</span>  <span class="s s170">Because their current business model depends on
overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices.</span>
<span class="s s171">They don't want search to work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s173">The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world.</span>  <span class="s s174">They dropped out
of the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this.</span>  <span class="s s175">They just
wanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research.</span>  <span class="s s176">Imagine
how much time you could save the world's engineers if they could
do searches online.</span>  <span class="s s177">So when I hear that a big, evil company is
trying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me
really want to help them.</span> <span class="s s178">It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts
than I do with most of the other startups we've funded.</span>  <span class="s s179">It just
made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.</span>  <span class="s s180">Why?</span>
<span class="s s181">Because they're good guys and they're trying to help the world.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s183">If you're benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,
customers, other companies, and potential employees.</span>  <span class="s s184">In the long
term the most important may be the potential employees.</span><span class="s s185">  I think
everyone knows now that
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html">
     good hackers
    </a>
    are much better than mediocre
ones.</span>  <span class="s s186">If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as
Google has, you have a big advantage.</span>  <span class="s s187">And the very best hackers
tend to be idealistic.</span>  <span class="s s188">They're not desperate for a job.</span>  <span class="s s189">They can
work wherever they want.</span>  <span class="s s190">So most want to work on things that will
make the world better.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s192">
    Compass
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s193">But the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as
a compass.</span>  <span class="s s194">One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you
have so many choices.</span>  <span class="s s195">There are just two or three of you, and a
thousand things you could do.</span> <span class="s s196">How do you decide?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s198">Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.</span>  <span class="s s199">You can hold
onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if
anything can.</span>  <span class="s s200">Follow it and it will take you through everything
you need to do.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s202">It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to
convince investors to give you money.</span>  <span class="s s203">If you're a good salesman,
you could try to just talk them into it.</span>  <span class="s s204">But the more reliable
route is to convince them through your users: if you make something
users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,
and that will convince any investor.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s206">Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions
in complex situations because it's stateless.</span>  <span class="s s207">It's like telling
the truth.</span>  <span class="s s208">The trouble with lying is that you have to remember
everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict
yourself.</span>  <span class="s s209">If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,
and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen
fast.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s211">For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of
which are still alive.</span>  <span class="s s212">(The rest have died or merged or been
acquired.</span><span class="s s213">)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out
you have to have a stateless algorithm.</span>  <span class="s s214">You can't have ulterior
motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't
remember them.</span>  <span class="s s215">So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the
founders.</span>  <span class="s s216">Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because
it's the only algorithm that works on that scale.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s218">When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be
claiming to be good yourself.</span>  <span class="s s219">So I want to say explicitly that I
am not a particularly good person.</span>  <span class="s s220">When I was a kid I was firmly
in the camp of bad.</span>  <span class="s s221">The way adults used the word good, it seemed
to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s223">
    You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation
and everyone says "He's
    <i>
     such
    </i>
    a great guy?</span><span class="s s224">"</span>  <span class="s s225">People never say
that about me.</span>  <span class="s s226">The best I get is "he means well.</span><span class="s s227">"</span>  <span class="s s228">I am not claiming
to be good.</span>  <span class="s s229">At best I speak good as a second language.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s231">So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.</span>
<span class="s s232">I'm suggesting it because it works.</span>  <span class="s s233">It will work not just as a
statement of "values," but as a guide to strategy,
and even a design spec for software.</span>  <span class="s s234">Don't just not be evil.</span>  <span class="s s235">Be
good.</span>
