   <span class="s s3">An investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage of
your startup.</span>  <span class="s s4">Should you take it?</span>  <span class="s s5">You're about to hire your first
employee.</span>  <span class="s s6">How much stock should you give him?</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s8">
   These are some of the hardest questions founders face.  And yet
both have the same answer:
  </span></p>
  <p><span class="s s9">
   1/(1 - n)
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">Whenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether
it's money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test
for whether to do it is the same.</span>  <span class="s s11">You should give up n% of your
company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome
enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the
whole company was before.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how
much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for
you to break even?</span>  <span class="s s14">Obviously it has to double: if you trade half
your company for something that more than doubles the company's
average outcome, you're net ahead.</span>  <span class="s s15">You have half as big a share
of something worth more than twice as much.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're
giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth
more than 1/(1 - n).</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s19">For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for
6% of your company.</span>  <span class="s s20">In this case, n is .</span><span class="s s21">06 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.</span><span class="s s22">064.</span>
<span class="s s23">So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your
average outcome by more than 6.</span><span class="s s24">4%.</span>  <span class="s s25">If we improve your outcome by
10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .</span><span class="s s26">94 you hold is worth
.</span><span class="s s27">94 x 1.</span><span class="s s28">1 = 1.</span><span class="s s29">034.</span><span class="s s30">

  <p>
   <span class="s s31">One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially
at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal.</span>
<span class="s s32">Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when
Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company.</span>
<span class="s s33">1/.</span><span class="s s34">7 = 1.</span><span class="s s35">43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve
your outcome by more than 43%.</span>  <span class="s s36">For the average startup, that would
be an extraordinary bargain.</span><span class="s s37">  It would improve the average startup's
prospects by more than 43% just to be able to
   <i>
    say
   </i>
   they were funded
by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s39">The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of
the company they take is artificially low.</span>  <span class="s s40">They don't even try to
get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings
to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still
theirs.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s42">The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and
funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are
1 in 300.</span> <span class="s s43">The companies that make it through are not average startups.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s45">Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal.</span>  <span class="s s46">It's
never just a straight trade of money for stock.</span>  <span class="s s47">But if it were,
taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s49">You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but
it works in the other direction.</span>  <span class="s s50">If i is the average outcome for
the company with the addition of some new person, then they're worth
n such that i = 1/(1 - n).</span>  <span class="s s51">Which means n = (i - 1)/i.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s53">For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire
an additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll increase the
average outcome of the whole company by 20%.</span>  <span class="s s54">n = (1.</span><span class="s s55">2 - 1)/1.</span><span class="s s56">2 =
.</span><span class="s s57">167.</span>  <span class="s s58">So you'll break even if you trade 16.</span><span class="s s59">7% of the company
for him.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s61">That doesn't mean 16.</span><span class="s s62">7% is the right amount of stock to give him.</span>
<span class="s s63">Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary
and overhead as well.</span>  <span class="s s64">And if the company merely breaks even on the
deal, there's no reason to do it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s66">I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should
multiply the annual rate by about 1.</span><span class="s s67">5.</span>  <span class="s s68">Most startups grow fast or
die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast
you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation,
which should be 3x this year's.</span>  <span class="s s69">If your valuation grows 3x a year,
the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.</span><span class="s s70">5
years' cost at the present valuation.</span><span class="s s71">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s72">How much of an additional margin should the company need as the
"activation energy" for the deal?</span>  <span class="s s73">Since this is in effect the
company's profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if
you're a hot opportunity, you can charge more.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s75">Let's run through an example.</span>  <span class="s s76">Suppose the company wants to make a
"profit" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above.</span>  <span class="s s77">So subtract a
third from 16.</span><span class="s s78">7% and we have 11.</span><span class="s s79">1% as his "retail" price.</span>  <span class="s s80">Suppose
further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead,
x 1.</span><span class="s s81">5 = $90k total.</span>  <span class="s s82">If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k
is 4.</span><span class="s s83">5%.</span>  <span class="s s84">11.</span><span class="s s85">1% - 4.</span><span class="s s86">5% = an offer of 6.</span><span class="s s87">6%.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s89">Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to
take little salary.</span>  <span class="s s90">It comes right out of stock that could otherwise
be given to them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s92">Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers.</span>  <span class="s s93">I'm not
claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula.</span>  <span class="s s94">Ultimately
you always have to guess.</span>  <span class="s s95">But at least know what you're guessing.</span>
<span class="s s96">If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical
grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates
of.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s98">And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity,
run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense.</span>  <span class="s s99">You should
always feel richer after trading equity.</span>  <span class="s s100">If the trade didn't
increase the value of your remaining shares enough to put you net
ahead, you wouldn't have (or shouldn't have) done it.</span>

   ] This is why we
can't believe anyone would think Y Combinator was a bad deal.  Does
anyone really think we're so useless that in three months we can't
improve a startup's prospects by 6.4%?
   </span><!--
Usually people who say we're a bad deal, like Seth Levine in <a
href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2007-07-17-ycombinator_N.htm">this
article</a>, simply don't understand what we do.   If all we did
was write checks, YC would be a bad deal.  But in fact the money
is the least of what we do.  No VC who has seen Demo Day first hand
has ever said YC took too much equity.

   ] The obvious choice
for your present valuation is the post-money valuation of your last
funding round.</span>  <span class="s s107">This probably undervalues the company, though,
because (a) unless your last round just happened, the company is
presumably worth more, and (b) the valuation of an early funding
round usually reflects some other contribution by the investors.</span>
