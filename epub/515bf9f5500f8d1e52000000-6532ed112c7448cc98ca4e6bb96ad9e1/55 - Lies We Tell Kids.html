   Lies We Tell Kids
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">

  </span></h2>
  <p><span class="s s3">
   Adults lie constantly to kids.  I'm not saying we should stop, but
I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">There may also be a benefit to us.</span>  <span class="s s5">We were all lied to as kids,
and some of the lies we were told still affect us.</span>  <span class="s s6">So by studying
the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of
lies we were told.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s8">I'm using the word "lie" in a very general sense: not just overt
falsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids.</span>
<span class="s s9">Though "lie" has negative connotations, I don't mean to suggest we
should never do this&acirc;&#128;&#148;just that we should pay attention when
we do.</span><span class="s s10">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s11">One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is
how broad the conspiracy is.</span>  <span class="s s12">All adults know what their culture 
lies to kids about: they're the questions you answer "Ask
your parents.</span><span class="s s13">"</span>  <span class="s s14">If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982
or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.</span>
<span class="s s15">But if a kid asks you "Is there a God?</span><span class="s s16">"</span> <span class="s s17">or "What's a prostitute?</span><span class="s s18">"</span>
<span class="s s19">you'll probably say "Ask your parents.</span><span class="s s20">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world
presented to them.</span>  <span class="s s23">The biggest disagreements are between parents
and schools, but even those are small.</span><span class="s s24"> Schools are careful what
they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what
parents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the
school into keeping
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=parents+complain+inappropriate+book">
    quiet
   </a>
   or move their kids to a new school.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so
only by discovering internal contradictions in what they're told.</span>
<span class="s s27">It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.</span>
<span class="s s28">Here's what happened to Einstein:</span>
   </p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s29">Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached
  the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not
  be true.</span>  <span class="s s30">The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking
  coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being
  deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression.</span><span class="s s31">
                  
                   [
    <a name="f2" href="#f2n">

    </a>
    ]
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s32">
   I remember that feeling.  By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt
from end to end.  That's why movies like
   </span><i><span class="s s33">
    The Matrix
   </span></i><span class="s s34">
   have such
resonance.  Every kid grows up in a fake world.  In a way it would
be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated
as a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by
taking a pill.
  
  </span><h3><span class="s s35">
   Protection
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s36">If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they
give is to protect them.</span>  <span class="s s37">And kids do need protecting.</span>  <span class="s s38">The environment
you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the
streets of a big city.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s40">That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.</span>  <span class="s s41">It's certainly
not a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is
quiet and warm and safe.</span>  <span class="s s42">But this harmless type of lie can turn
sour if left unexamined.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s44">Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment
as a newborn till age 18.</span>  <span class="s s45">To mislead someone so grossly about the
world would seem not protection but abuse.</span>  <span class="s s46">That's an extreme
example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes
national news.</span>  <span class="s s47">But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in
the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s49">The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment
for children to grow up in.</span>  <span class="s s50">And it seems great for 10 year olds.</span>
<span class="s s51">I liked living in suburbia when I was 10.</span>  <span class="s s52">I didn't notice how
sterile it was.</span>  <span class="s s53">My whole world was no bigger than a few friends'
houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.</span>  <span class="s s54">On a log scale
I was midway between crib and globe.</span>  <span class="s s55">A suburban street was just
the right size.</span>  <span class="s s56">But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel
suffocatingly fake.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s58">Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it's often frustrating at
15.</span>  <span class="s s59">This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one
reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed
for 10 year olds.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s61">What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them
in suburbia?</span>  <span class="s s62">A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that
her 3 year old daughter "saw too much.</span><span class="s s63">"</span>  <span class="s s64">Off the top of my head,
that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,
gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of
oddness, and violent anger.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s66">I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year
old.</span>  <span class="s s67">I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even
then.</span>  <span class="s s68">I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I
saw.</span>  <span class="s s69">It would be too frightening.</span>  <span class="s s70">A lot of the things adults
conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be
frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such
things.</span>  <span class="s s71">Misleading the child is just a byproduct.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s73">This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to
kids.</span>  <span class="s s74">But because the lies are indirect we don't keep a very strict
accounting of them.</span>  <span class="s s75">Parents know they've concealed the facts about
sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.</span>
<span class="s s76">But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world
and the cocoon they grew up in.</span>  <span class="s s77">Combine this with the confidence
parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new
crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s79">Don't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?</span>  <span class="s s80">Actually
this seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.</span>
<span class="s s81">In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult
world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.</span>  <span class="s s82">They
could see they weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith.</span>
<span class="s s83">In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we
do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment
are a recent invention.</span>  <span class="s s84">Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got
this first.</span>  <span class="s s85">Children of kings and great magnates were the first
to grow up out of touch with the world.</span>  <span class="s s86">Suburbia means half the
population can live like kings in that respect.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s88">
   Sex (and Drugs)
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s89">I'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.</span>
<span class="s s90">I'd worry less about what they'd see, and more about what they'd
do.</span>  <span class="s s91">I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,
and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.</span>  <span class="s s92">They seemed to have lost
their virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried
more drugs than I'd even heard of.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s94">The reasons parents don't want their teenage kids having sex are
complex.</span>  <span class="s s95">There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases.</span>  <span class="s s96">But those aren't the only reasons parents
don't want their kids having sex.</span>  <span class="s s97">The average parents of a 14 year
old girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were
zero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s99">Kids can probably sense they aren't being told the whole story.</span>
<span class="s s100">After all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as
much a problem for adults, and they have sex.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s102">What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?</span>
<span class="s s103">Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it's probably inborn.</span>  <span class="s s104">But
if it's inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of
societies where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have
sex&acirc;&#128;&#148;indeed, where it's normal for 14 year olds to become
mothers.</span>  <span class="s s105">So what's going on?</span>  <span class="s s106">There does seem to be a universal
taboo against sex with prepubescent children.</span>  <span class="s s107">One can imagine
evolutionary reasons for that.</span>  <span class="s s108">And I think this is the main reason
parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having
sex.</span>  <span class="s s109">They still think of them as children, even though biologically
they're not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:
that it can cause great pleasure.</span>  <span class="s s112">That's what makes sex and drugs
so dangerous.</span> <span class="s s113">The desire for them can cloud one's judgement&acirc;&#128;&#148;which
is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the
already wretched judgement of a teenage kid.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s115">Here parents' desires conflict.</span>  <span class="s s116">Older societies told kids they had
bad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.</span>
<span class="s s117">This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in
their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly
lied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie
again about all the things they might get into trouble with if they
believed us.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s119">If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would
be: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy
judgement.</span>  <span class="s s120">People with twice your experience still get burned by
them.</span>  <span class="s s121">But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn't
be convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is
believing you have good judgement.</span>  <span class="s s122">When you're too weak to lift
something, you can tell, but when you're making a decision impetuously,
you're all the more sure of it.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s124">
   Innocence
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s125">Another reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that
they want to keep them innocent.</span>  <span class="s s126">Adults have a certain model of
how kids are supposed to behave, and it's different from what they
expect of other adults.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s128">One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed
to use.</span>  <span class="s s129">Most parents use words when talking to other adults that
they wouldn't want their kids using.</span>  <span class="s s130">They try to hide even the
existence of these words for as long as they can.</span>  <span class="s s131">And this is
another of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone
knows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s133">I've never heard more different explanations for anything parents
tell kids than why they shouldn't swear.</span>  <span class="s s134">Every parent I know forbids
their children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same
justification.</span>  <span class="s s135">It's clear most start with not wanting kids to
swear, then make up the reason afterward.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s137">
   So my theory about what's going on is that the
   <i>
    function
   </i>
   of
swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.</span>  <span class="s s138">There's no difference
in the meaning of "shit" and "poopoo.</span><span class="s s139">"</span>  <span class="s s140">So why should one be ok for
kids to say and one forbidden?</span>  <span class="s s141">The only explanation is: by definition.</span><span class="s s142">
                                                               
                                                                [
   <a name="f3" href="#f3n">
    3
   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s143">Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for
adults?</span>   <span class="s s144">The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning
against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of
his mouth is very disconcerting.</span>  <span class="s s145">But why?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s147">One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we're programmed to
like certain kinds of helplessness.</span>  <span class="s s148">I've several times heard mothers
say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's
mispronunciations because they were so cute.</span>  <span class="s s149">And if you think about
it, cuteness is helplessness.</span> <span class="s s150">Toys and cartoon characters meant to
be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual
limbs.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s152">It's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect
helpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for
so long.</span>  <span class="s s153">Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they'd be
very annoying.</span>  <span class="s s154">They'd merely seem like incompetent adults.</span>  <span class="s s155">But
there's more to it than that.</span>  <span class="s s156">The reason our hypothetical jaded
10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying,
but that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early.</span>  <span class="s s157">To
be jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any
theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty
narrow one.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s159">Innocence is also open-mindedness.</span>  <span class="s s160">We want kids to be innocent so
they can continue to learn.</span>  <span class="s s161">Paradoxical as it sounds, there are
some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of
knowledge.</span>  <span class="s s162">If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal
place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're
better off learning it last.</span>  <span class="s s163">Otherwise you won't bother learning
much more.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s165">Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think
this is a coincidence.</span>  <span class="s s166">I think they've deliberately avoided learning
about certain things.</span>  <span class="s s167">Certainly I do.</span>  <span class="s s168">I used to think I wanted
to know everything.</span>  <span class="s s169">Now I know I don't.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s171">
   Death
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s172">After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about
to kids.</span>  <span class="s s173">Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.</span>  <span class="s s174">But
why do we conceal death from kids?</span>   <span class="s s175">Probably because small children
are particularly horrified by it.</span>  <span class="s s176">They want to feel safe, and death
is the ultimate threat.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s178">One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the
death of our first cat.</span>  <span class="s s179">Over the years, as we asked for more
details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite
elaborate.</span>  <span class="s s180">The cat had died at the vet's office.</span>  <span class="s s181">Of what?</span>  <span class="s s182">Of the
anaesthesia itself.</span>  <span class="s s183">Why was the cat at the vet's office?</span>  <span class="s s184">To be
fixed.</span>  <span class="s s185">And why had such a routine operation killed it?</span>  <span class="s s186">It wasn't
the vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia
was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have
known this in advance.</span>  <span class="s s187">It was not till we were in our twenties
that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally
stepped on the cat and broken its back.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s189">They didn't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat
heaven.</span>  <span class="s s190">My parents never claimed that people or animals who died
had "gone to a better place," or that we'd meet them again.</span>  <span class="s s191">It
didn't seem to harm us.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s193">My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my
grandfather.</span>  <span class="s s194">She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and
when she said something to him, he didn't answer.</span>  <span class="s s195">He seemed to be
asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't.</span>  <span class="s s196">"He was
gone.</span><span class="s s197">"</span> <span class="s s198">Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.</span>  <span class="s s199">Later I
learned it hadn't been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most
of a day to kill him.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s201">Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing
the subject when death came up.</span>  <span class="s s202">I can't remember that, of course,
but I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp I was
going to die till I was about 19.</span>  <span class="s s203">How could I have missed something
so obvious for so long?</span>  <span class="s s204">Now that I've seen parents managing the
subject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly
turned aside.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s206">On this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids.</span>  <span class="s s207">Kids often
want to be lied to.</span>  <span class="s s208">They want to believe they're living in a
comfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe
it.</span><span class="s s209">
                                                                                       
                                                                                        [

  <h3><span class="s s210">
   Identity
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s211">Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group
and want their kids to feel it too.</span>  <span class="s s212">This usually requires two
different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he
or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes
differentiate themselves by believing.</span><span class="s s213">
                                                                                           
                                                                                            [
   <a name="f5" href="#f5n">

   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s214">Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity
is one of the stickiest things you can tell them.</span>  <span class="s s215">Almost anything
else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when
they start to think for themselves.</span>  <span class="s s216">But if you tell a kid they're
a member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s218">This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated
lies parents tell.</span>  <span class="s s219">When parents are of different religions, they'll
often agree between themselves that their children will be "raised
as Xes.</span><span class="s s220">"</span>  <span class="s s221">And it works.</span> <span class="s s222">The kids obligingly grow up considering
themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen
the other way, they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s224">One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.</span>
<span class="s s225">The truth is common property.</span>  <span class="s s226">You can't distinguish your group by
doing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.</span>
<span class="s s227">If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to
do things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.</span>
<span class="s s228">And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary
and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by
"outsiders" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing
children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.</span>  <span class="s s229">If they
aren't an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs
and customs?</span>  <span class="s s230">If they aren't an X, why do all the non-Xes call them
one?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s232">This form of lie is not without its uses.</span>  <span class="s s233">You can use it to carry
a payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of
the child's identity.</span>  <span class="s s234">You can tell the child that in addition to
never wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by
a giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating
fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.</span>  <span class="s s235">Then X
children will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be
honest and industrious.</span>

   <span class="s s241">One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain
power over them.</span>  <span class="s s242">Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a
child molester telling his victims they'll get in trouble if they
tell anyone what happened to them.</span>  <span class="s s243">Others seem more innocent; it
depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they
use it for.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s245">Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.</span>
<span class="s s246">Usually their motives are mixed.</span>  <span class="s s247">For example, a father who has an
affair generally conceals it from his children.</span>  <span class="s s248">His motive is
partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce
the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)
that he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes.</span>

one called
   <i>
    Why Are We Getting a Divorce?
   </i>
   It begins with the three
most important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:
   </span></p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s253">You shouldn't put the blame on one parent, because divorce is
  never only one person's fault.</span><span class="s s254">

   Really?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly
his wife's fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.
Maybe it's more important for kids to respect their parents than
to know the truth about them.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s256">But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist
on high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling
they fall hopelessly short.</span>  <span class="s s257">They walk around feeling horribly evil
for having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around
them are doing much worse things.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s259">This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.</span>  <span class="s s260">The more
confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a
question "I don't know.</span><span class="s s261">"</span>  <span class="s s262">Less confident people feel they have to
have an answer or they'll look bad.</span>  <span class="s s263">My parents were pretty good
about admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been
told a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard
a teacher say "I don't know" till I got to college.</span>  <span class="s s264">I remember
because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of
a class.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s266">The first hint I had that teachers weren't omniscient came in sixth
grade, after my father contradicted something I'd learned in school.</span>
<span class="s s267">When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father
replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about&acirc;&#128;&#148;that
he was just an elementary school teacher, after all.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s269">
   <i>
    Just
   </i>
   a teacher?</span>  <span class="s s270">The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.</span>
<span class="s s271">Didn't teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?</span>
<span class="s s272">And if not, why were they the ones teaching us?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s274">The sad fact is, US public school teachers don't generally understand
the stuff they're teaching very well.</span>  <span class="s s275">There are some sterling
exceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank
academically near the bottom of the college population.</span>  <span class="s s276">So the
fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible
shows what a job the system must have done on my brain.</span>

  <h3><span class="s s278">
   School
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s279">What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.</span>  <span class="s s280">The most
excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to
learn.</span>  <span class="s s281">The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the
curriculum in the name of simplification.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s283">Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various
powerful groups want kids to be told.</span>  <span class="s s284">The lies are rarely overt.</span>
<span class="s s285">Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing
certain topics at the expense of others.</span>  <span class="s s286">The view of history we
got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one
representative of each powerful group.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s288">The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, and
George Washington Carver.</span>   <span class="s s289">Einstein was a big deal because his
work led to the atom bomb.</span>  <span class="s s290">Marie Curie was involved with X-rays.</span>
<span class="s s291">But I was mystified about Carver.</span>  <span class="s s292">He seemed to have done stuff
with peanuts.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s294">It's obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (and
for that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman),
but as a kid I was confused for years about him.</span>  <span class="s s295">I wonder if it
wouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there
weren't any famous black scientists.</span>  <span class="s s296">Ranking George Washington
Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about
the obstacles blacks faced in his time.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s298">As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.</span>  <span class="s s299">By the time
you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was
pretty much pure propaganda.</span>  <span class="s s300">For example, we were taught to regard
political leaders as saints&acirc;&#128;&#148;especially the recently martyred
Kennedy and King.</span>  <span class="s s301">It was astonishing to learn later that they'd
both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to
boot.</span>  <span class="s s302">(By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability
to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.</span><span class="s s303">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s304">I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them
lies, because practically everyone who has anything to say about
it has some kind of spin to put on it.</span><span class="s s305">  Much recent history
   <i>
    consists
   </i>
   of spin.</span>  <span class="s s306">It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts
like that.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s308">Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the way
to succeed is through following "the rules.</span><span class="s s309">"</span>  <span class="s s310">In fact most such

   <span class="s s318">A few Thanksgivings ago, a friend of mine found himself in a situation
that perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie
to kids.</span>  <span class="s s319">As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly
perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted
to die.</span>  <span class="s s320">Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly
improvised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived
its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner.</span>
<span class="s s321">And that (phew) was the end of that.</span>

   Whenever we lie to kids to protect them, we're usually also lying
to keep the peace.

  <p>
   <span class="s s324">One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up
thinking horrible things are normal.</span>  <span class="s s325">It's hard for us to feel a
sense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been
trained not to worry about.</span>  <span class="s s326">When I was about 10 I saw a documentary
on pollution that put me into a panic.</span>  <span class="s s327">It seemed the planet was
being irretrievably ruined.</span>  <span class="s s328">I went to my mother afterward to ask
if this was so.</span>  <span class="s s329">I don't remember what she said, but she made me
feel better, so I stopped worrying about it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s331">That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old.</span>
<span class="s s332">But we should understand the price.</span>  <span class="s s333">This sort of lie is one of the

faster than regular aerobic respiration.</span>  <span class="s s339">But this process builds
up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break
down, so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while
to recover.</span>

  <p>
   <span class="s s341">We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt.</span>  <span class="s s342">We were told a

may have been necessary.</span>  <span class="s s344">Some probably weren't.</span>  <span class="s s345">But we all arrive
at adulthood with heads full of lies.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s347">There's never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all
the lies they told you.</span>  <span class="s s348">They've forgotten most of them.</span>  <span class="s s349">So if

completely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid, but
it's worth trying.</span>  <span class="s s354">I've found that whenever I've been able to undo
a lie I was told, a lot of other things fell into place.</span>

One reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that
the lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we

shocking how much they lied to them.</span>  <span class="s s371">Like us, they did it with the
best intentions.</span>  <span class="s s372">So if we think we're as open as one could reasonably
be with children, we're probably fooling ourselves.</span>  <span class="s s373">Odds are people
