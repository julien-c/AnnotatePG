    <!--<i>(This is an expanded version of the keynote lecture at the
International ICAD User's Group conference in May 2002.
It explains how a language
developed in 1958 manages to be the most powerful  
available even today, what power is and when you need it, and
why pointy-haired bosses (ideally, your
competitors' pointy-haired bosses) deliberately ignore this issue.)<b>Note:</b> In this talk by "Lisp", I mean the Lisp family oflanguages, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, EuLisp,
Goo, Arc, etc.</i>
-->
    <!-- Let me start by admitting that I don't know much about ICAD.
I do know that it's written in Lisp, and in fact includes Lisp,
in the sense that it lets users create and run Lisp programs.It's fairly common for programs written in Lisp to include
Lisp.  Emacs does, and so does Yahoo Store.
But if you think about it, that's kind of strange.
How many programs written in C include C, in the sense that   
the user actually runs the C compiler while he's using the
application?  I can't think of any, unless you count Unix
as an application.  We're only a minute into this talk and
already Lisp is looking kind of unusual.Now, it is probably not news to any of you that Lisp is   
looking unusual.  In fact, that was probably the first thing
you noticed about it.Believe it or not, there is a reason Lisp code looks
so strange.  Lisp doesn't look this way because it was designed
by a bunch of pointy-headed academics.  It <i>was</i>
designed by pointy-headed academics, but they had hard-headed  
engineering reasons for making the syntax look so strange.<b>Are All Languages Equivalent?</b>
--><span class="s s3">
    In the software business there is an ongoing
struggle between the pointy-headed academics, and another
equally formidable force, the pointy-haired bosses.  Everyone
knows who the pointy-haired boss is, right?  I think most
people in the technology world not only recognize this
cartoon character, but know the actual person in their company
that he is modelled upon.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s4">The pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualities
that are common by themselves, but rarely seen together:
(a) he knows nothing whatsoever about technology, and
(b) he has very strong opinions about it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s6">Suppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software.</span>
<span class="s s7">The pointy-haired boss has no idea how this software
has to work, and can't tell one programming language from
another, and yet he knows what language you should write it in.</span>
<span class="s s8">Exactly.</span>  <span class="s s9">He thinks you should write it in Java.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s11">Why does he think this?</span>  <span class="s s12">Let's
take a look inside the brain of the pointy-haired boss.</span>  <span class="s s13">What
he's thinking is something like this.</span>  <span class="s s14">Java is a standard.</span>
<span class="s s15">I know it must be, because I read about it in the press all the time.</span>
<span class="s s16">Since it is a standard, I won't get in trouble for using it.</span>
<span class="s s17">And that also means there will always be lots of Java programmers,
so if the programmers working for me now quit, as programmers
working for me mysteriously always do, I can easily replace
them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s19">Well, this doesn't sound that unreasonable.</span>  <span class="s s20">But it's all
based on one unspoken assumption, and that assumption
turns out to be false.</span>  <span class="s s21">The pointy-haired boss believes that all
programming languages are pretty much equivalent.</span>
<span class="s s22">If that were true, he would be right on
target.</span>  <span class="s s23">If languages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever 
language everyone else is using.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">But all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can prove
this to you without even getting into the differences between them.</span>
<span class="s s26">If you asked the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language     
software should be written in, he would have answered with as
little hesitation as he does today.</span>  <span class="s s27">Software should be  
written in C++.</span>  <span class="s s28">But if languages are all equivalent, why should the
pointy-haired boss's opinion ever change?</span>  <span class="s s29">In fact, why should
the developers of Java have even bothered to create a new
language?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s31">Presumably, if you create a new language, it's because you think
it's better in some way than what people already had.</span>  <span class="s s32">And in fact, Gosling
makes it clear in the first Java white paper that Java
was designed to fix some problems with C++.</span>
<span class="s s33">So there you have it: languages are not all equivalent.</span>
<span class="s s34">If you follow the
trail through the pointy-haired boss's brain to Java and then
back through Java's history to its origins, you end up holding
an idea that contradicts the assumption you started with.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s36">So, who's right?</span>  <span class="s s37">James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss?</span>
<span class="s s38">Not surprisingly, Gosling is right.</span><span class="s s39">  Some languages
    <i>
     are
    </i>
    better,
for certain problems, than others.</span>  <span class="s s40">And you know, that raises some
interesting questions.</span>  <span class="s s41">Java was designed to be better, for certain
problems, than C++.</span>  <span class="s s42">What problems?</span>  <span class="s s43">When is Java better and 
when is C++?</span>  <span class="s s44">Are there situations where other languages are
better than either of them?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s46">Once you start considering this question, you have opened a
real can of worms.  If the pointy-haired boss had to think
about the problem in its full complexity, it would make his
brain explode.</span>  <span class="s s47">As long as he considers all languages   
equivalent, all he has to do is choose the one
that seems to have the most momentum, and since that is more
a question of fashion than technology, even he
can probably get the right answer.</span>
<span class="s s48">But if languages vary, he suddenly
has to solve two simultaneous equations, trying to find
an optimal balance between two things he knows nothing   
about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leading
languages for the problem he needs to solve, and the odds of
finding programmers, libraries, etc.</span> <span class="s s49">for each.</span>
<span class="s s50">If that's what's on the other side of the door, it
is no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn't want to open it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s52">The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages
are equivalent is that it's not true.</span>  <span class="s s53">But the advantage is 
that it makes your life a lot simpler.</span>
<span class="s s54">And I think that's the main reason the idea is so widespread.</span><span class="s s55">
It is a
    <i>
     comfortable
    </i>
    idea.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s57">We know that Java must be pretty good, because it is the
cool, new programming language.</span>  <span class="s s58">Or is it?</span>  <span class="s s59">If you look at the world of
programming languages from a distance, it looks like Java is
the latest thing.</span>  <span class="s s60">(From far enough away, all you can see is
the large, flashing billboard paid for by Sun.</span><span class="s s61">)
But if you look at this world
up close, you find that there are degrees of coolness.</span>  <span class="s s62">Within
the hacker subculture, there is another language called Perl
that is considered a lot cooler than Java.</span>  <span class="s s63">Slashdot, for
example, is generated by Perl.</span>  <span class="s s64">I don't think you would find
those guys using Java Server Pages.</span><span class="s s65">  But there is another,
newer language, called Python, whose users tend to look down on Perl,
and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/accgen.html">
     more
    </a>
    waiting in the wings.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s67">If you look at these languages in order, Java, Perl, Python,
you notice an interesting pattern.</span>  <span class="s s68">At least, you notice this
pattern if you are a Lisp hacker.</span>  <span class="s s69">Each one is progressively 
more like Lisp.</span>  <span class="s s70">Python copies even features
that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes.</span>
<span class="s s71">You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line.</span>
<span class="s s72">It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up 
with 1958.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s74">
    Catching Up with Math
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">What I mean is that
Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958,
and popular programming languages are only now
catching up with the ideas he developed then.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s77">Now, how could that be true?</span>  <span class="s s78">Isn't computer technology something
that changes very rapidly?</span>  <span class="s s79">I mean, in 1958, computers were
refrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of    
a wristwatch.</span>  <span class="s s80">How could any technology that old even be
relevant, let alone superior to the latest developments?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s82">I'll tell you how.</span>  <span class="s s83">It's because Lisp was not really
designed to be a programming language, at least not in the sense
we mean today.</span>  <span class="s s84">What we mean by a programming language is
something we use to tell a computer what to do.</span><span class="s s85">   McCarthy
did eventually intend to develop a programming language in
this sense, but the Lisp that we actually ended up with was based
on something separate that he did as a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html">
     theoretical exercise
    </a>
    -- an effort
to define a more convenient alternative to the Turing Machine.</span>
<span class="s s86">As McCarthy said later,</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s87">Another way to show that Lisp was neater than Turing machines
was to write a universal Lisp function
and show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than the
description of a universal Turing machine.</span><span class="s s88">
This was the Lisp function
     <a target="_blank" href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.lisp">
      <i>
       eval
      </i>
     </a>
     .</span><span class="s s89">.</span><span class="s s90">.</span><span class="s s91">, 
which computes the value of
a Lisp expression.</span><span class="s s92">.</span><span class="s s93">.</span><span class="s s94">.</span><span class="s s95">
Writing
     <i>
      eval
     </i>
     required inventing a notation representing Lisp
functions as Lisp data, and such a notation
was devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought that
it would be used to express Lisp programs in practice.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s97">
    What happened next was that, some time in late 1958, Steve Russell,
one of McCarthy's
grad students, looked at this definition of
    </span><i><span class="s s98">
     eval
    </span></i><span class="s s99">
    and realized  
that if he translated it into machine language, the result
would be a Lisp interpreter.
   
   </span><p><span class="s s100">
    This was a big surprise at the time.
Here is what McCarthy said about it later in an interview:
    </span></p><blockquote><span class="s s101">
     Steve Russell said, look, why don't I program this
     <i>
      eval
     </i>
     .</span><span class="s s102">.</span><span class="s s103">.</span><span class="s s104">, and
I said to him, ho, ho, you're confusing theory with practice,
this
     <i>
      eval
     </i>
     is intended for reading, not for
computing.</span> <span class="s s105">But he went ahead and did it.</span><span class="s s106"> That is, he compiled the
     <i>
      eval
     </i>
     in my paper into [IBM] 704 machine
code, fixing bugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter,
which it certainly was.</span> <span class="s s107">So at that point Lisp
had essentially the form that it has today.</span><span class="s s108">.</span><span class="s s109">.</span><span class="s s110">.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s112">
    Suddenly, in a matter of weeks I think, McCarthy found his theoretical
exercise transformed into an actual programming language-- and a
more powerful one than he had intended.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s113">So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not
obsolete is that it was not technology but math, and
math doesn't get stale.</span>   <span class="s s114">The right thing to compare Lisp
to is not 1950s hardware, but, say, the Quicksort
algorithm, which was discovered in 1960 and is still
the fastest general-purpose sort.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s116">There is one other language still
surviving from the 1950s, Fortran, and it represents the
opposite approach to language design.</span>  <span class="s s117">Lisp was a
piece of theory that unexpectedly got turned into a
programming language.</span>  <span class="s s118">Fortran was developed intentionally as
a programming language, but what we would now consider a
very low-level one.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s120">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/history.html">
     Fortran I
    </a>
    , the language that was
developed in 1956, was a very different animal from present-day
Fortran.</span>   <span class="s s121">Fortran I was pretty much assembly
language with math.</span>  <span class="s s122">In some ways it was less
powerful than more recent assembly languages; there were no   
subroutines, for example, only branches.</span>
<span class="s s123">Present-day Fortran is now arguably closer to Lisp than to
Fortran I.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s125">Lisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees, 
one rooted in math and one rooted in machine architecture.</span>
<span class="s s126">These two trees have been converging ever since.</span>
<span class="s s127">Lisp started out powerful, and over the next twenty years
got fast.</span>  <span class="s s128">So-called mainstream languages started out
fast, and over the next forty years gradually got more powerful,
until now the most advanced
of them are fairly close to Lisp.</span>
<span class="s s129">Close, but they are still missing a few things.</span><span class="s s130">.</span><span class="s s131">.</span><span class="s s132">.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s134">
    What Made Lisp Different
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s135">When it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine new
ideas.</span>  <span class="s s136">Some of these we now take for granted, others are
only seen in more advanced languages, and two are still
unique to Lisp.</span>  <span class="s s137">The nine ideas are, in order of their
adoption by the mainstream,</span>
    </p><ol><li>
      <span class="s s138">Conditionals.</span>  <span class="s s139">A conditional is an if-then-else
construct.</span>  <span class="s s140">We take these for granted now, but Fortran I
didn't have them.</span> <span class="s s141">It had only a conditional goto
closely based on the underlying machine instruction.</span>
     </li>
    </ol><p>
    </p><li>
     <span class="s s143">A function type.</span> <span class="s s144">In Lisp, functions are
a data type just like integers or strings.</span>
<span class="s s145">They have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,
can be passed as arguments, and so on.</span>
    </li>
   
   <p>
    </p><li><span class="s s147">
     Recursion.  Lisp was the first programming language to
support it.
    </span></li>
   
   <p>
    </p><li>
     <span class="s s148">Dynamic typing.</span>  <span class="s s149">In Lisp, all variables
are effectively pointers.</span> <span class="s s150">Values are what
have types, not variables, and assigning or binding
variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.</span>
    </li>
   
   <p>
    </p><li><span class="s s152">
     Garbage-collection.
    </span></li>
   
   <p>
    </p><li>
     <span class="s s153">Programs composed of expressions.</span>  <span class="s s154">Lisp programs are
trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.</span>
<span class="s s155">This is in contrast to Fortran
and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between
expressions and statements.</span>
    </li>
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s157">It was natural to have this
distinction in Fortran I because
you could not nest statements.</span>  <span class="s s158">And
so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was
no point in making anything else return a value, because
there could not be anything waiting for it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s160">This limitation
went away with the arrival of block-structured languages,
but by then it was too late.</span> <span class="s s161">The distinction between
expressions and statements was entrenched.</span>  <span class="s s162">It spread from
Fortran into Algol and then to both their descendants.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    </p><li>
     <span class="s s164">A symbol type.</span>  <span class="s s165">Symbols are effectively pointers to strings
stored in a hash table.</span>  <span class="s s166">So
you can test equality by comparing a pointer,
instead of comparing each character.</span>
    </li>
   
   <p>
    </p><li><span class="s s168">
     A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.
    </span></li>
   
   <p>
    </p><li>
     <span class="s s169">The whole language there all the time.</span>  <span class="s s170">There is
no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.</span>
<span class="s s171">You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code
while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.</span>
    </li>
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s173">Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax;
running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling
at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension
language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime
enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an
idea recently reinvented as XML.</span>
    <span class="s s174">When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were far
removed from ordinary programming practice, which was
dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.</span>
<span class="s s175">Over time, the default language, embodied
in a succession of popular languages, has
gradually evolved toward Lisp.</span>  <span class="s s176">Ideas 1-5 are now widespread.</span>
<span class="s s177">Number 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.</span>  
<span class="s s178">Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be    
any syntax for it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s180">As for number 8, this may be the most interesting of the
lot.</span>  <span class="s s181">Ideas 8 and 9 only became part of Lisp
by accident, because Steve Russell implemented
something McCarthy had never intended to be implemented.</span>
<span class="s s182">And yet these ideas turn out to be responsible for
both Lisp's strange appearance and its most distinctive
features.</span>  <span class="s s183">Lisp looks strange not so much because
it has a strange syntax as because it has no syntax;
you express programs directly in the parse trees that
get built behind the scenes when other languages are
parsed, and these trees are made
of lists, which are Lisp data structures.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s185">Expressing the language in its own data structures turns
out to be a very powerful feature.</span> <span class="s s186">Ideas 8 and 9
together mean that you
can write programs that write programs.  That may sound
like a bizarre idea, but it's an everyday thing in Lisp.</span><span class="s s187"> 
The most common way to do it is with something called a
    <i>
     macro.
    </i>
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s188">The term "macro" does not mean in Lisp what it means in other
languages.</span>
<span class="s s189">A Lisp macro can be anything from an abbreviation
to a compiler for a new language.</span><span class="s s190">
If you want to really understand Lisp,
or just expand your programming horizons, I would
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">
     learn more
    </a>
    about macros.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s192">Macros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as
I know, unique to Lisp.</span>
<span class="s s193">This is partly because in order to have macros you
probably have to make your language look as strange as
Lisp.</span>  <span class="s s194">It may also be because if you do add that final
increment of power, you can no
longer claim to have invented a new language, but only
a new dialect of Lisp.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s196">I mention this mostly
as a joke, but it is quite true.</span> <span class="s s197">If you define
a language that has car, cdr, cons, quote, cond, atom,
eq, and
a notation for functions expressed as lists, then you
can build all the rest of Lisp out of it.</span>  <span class="s s198">That is in
fact the defining quality of Lisp: it was in order to
make this so that McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it has.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s200">
    Where Languages Matter
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s201">So suppose Lisp does represent a kind of limit     
that mainstream languages are approaching asymptotically-- does
that mean you should actually use it to write software?</span>
<span class="s s202">How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?</span>
<span class="s s203">Isn't it wiser, sometimes, not to be
at the very edge of innovation?</span>
<span class="s s204">And isn't popularity to some extent
its own justification?</span>  <span class="s s205">Isn't the pointy-haired boss right,
for example, to want to use a language for which he can easily
hire programmers?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s207">There are, of course, projects where the choice of programming
language doesn't matter much.</span>  <span class="s s208">As a
rule, the more demanding the application, the more
leverage you get from using a powerful language.</span>  <span class="s s209">But
plenty of projects are not demanding at all.</span>
<span class="s s210">Most programming probably consists of writing 
little glue programs, and for 
little glue programs you
can use any language that you're already
familiar with and that has good libraries for whatever you
need to do.</span>  <span class="s s211">If you just need to feed data from one   
Windows app to another, sure, use Visual Basic.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s213">You can write little glue programs in Lisp too
(I use it as a desktop calculator), but the biggest win
for languages like Lisp is at the other end of
the spectrum, where you need to write sophisticated
programs to solve hard problems in the face of fierce competition.</span><span class="s s214">
A good example is the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/carl.html">
     airline fare search program
    </a>
    that ITA Software licenses to
Orbitz.</span>  <span class="s s215">These
guys entered a market already dominated by two big,
entrenched competitors, Travelocity and Expedia, and  
seem to have just humiliated them technologically.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s217">The core of ITA's application is a 200,000 line Common Lisp program
that searches many orders of magnitude more possibilities
than their competitors, who apparently

<span class="s s218">(Though ITA is also in a sense
using a mainframe-era programming language.</span><span class="s s219">)
I have never seen any of ITA's code, but according to
one of their top hackers they use a lot of macros,
and I am not surprised to hear it.</span>

    Centripetal Forces
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s222">I'm not saying there is no cost to using uncommon  
technologies.</span>  <span class="s s223">The pointy-haired boss is not completely
mistaken to worry about this.</span>  <span class="s s224">But because he doesn't understand
the risks, he tends to magnify them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s226">I can think of three problems that could arise from using
less common languages.</span>  <span class="s s227">Your programs might not work well with
programs written in other languages.</span>  <span class="s s228">You might have fewer
libraries at your disposal.</span>  <span class="s s229">And you might have trouble
hiring programmers.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s231">How much of a problem is each of these?</span>  <span class="s s232">The importance of
the first varies depending on whether you have control
over the whole system.</span>  <span class="s s233">If you're writing software that has
to run on a remote user's machine on top of a buggy,
closed operating system (I mention no names), there may be
advantages to writing your application in the
same language as the OS.</span>
<span class="s s234">But if you control the whole system and
have the source code of all the parts, as ITA presumably does, you
can use whatever languages you want.</span>  <span class="s s235">If
any incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s237">
    In server-based applications you can
get away with using the most advanced technologies,
and I think this is the main
cause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the "

     programming language
renaissance
    </a>
    .</span><span class="s s238">"</span>  <span class="s s239">This is why we even hear about new
languages like Perl and Python.</span>  <span class="s s240">We're not hearing about these
languages because people are using them to write Windows
apps, but because people are using them on servers.</span><span class="s s241">  And as
software shifts
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/road.html">
     off the desktop
    </a>
    and onto servers (a future even
Microsoft seems resigned to), there will be less
and less pressure to use middle-of-the-road technologies.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s243">As for libraries, their importance also
depends on the application.</span>  <span class="s s244">For less demanding problems,
the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power
of the language.</span>  <span class="s s245">Where is the breakeven point?</span>  <span class="s s246">Hard to say
exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you'd
be likely to call an application.</span>  <span class="s s247">If a company considers
itself to be in the software business, and they're writing
an application that will be one of their products,
then it will probably involve several hackers and take at
least six months to write.</span>  <span class="s s248">In a project of that
size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh
the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s250">The third worry of the pointy-haired boss, the difficulty
of hiring programmers, I think is a red herring.</span>   <span class="s s251">How many
hackers do you need to hire, after all?</span>  <span class="s s252">Surely by now we
all know that software is best developed by teams of less
than ten people.</span>   <span class="s s253">And you shouldn't have trouble hiring
hackers on that scale for any language anyone has ever heard
of.</span>  <span class="s s254">If you can't find ten Lisp hackers, then your company is
probably based in the wrong city for developing software.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s256">In fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases the
size of the team you need, because (a) if you use a more powerful
language you probably won't need as many hackers,
and (b) hackers who work in more advanced languages are likely
to be smarter.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s258">I'm not saying that you won't get a lot of pressure to use
what are perceived as "standard" technologies.</span>  <span class="s s259">At Viaweb
(now Yahoo Store),
we raised some eyebrows among VCs and potential acquirers by
using Lisp.</span><span class="s s260">  But we also raised eyebrows by using
generic Intel boxes as servers instead of
"industrial strength" servers like Suns, for using a
then-obscure open-source Unix variant called FreeBSD instead
of a real commercial OS like Windows NT, for ignoring
a supposed e-commerce standard called

   <p>
    <span class="s s262">You can't let the suits make technical decisions for you.</span>
<span class="s s263">Did it
alarm some potential acquirers that we used Lisp?</span>  <span class="s s264">Some, slightly,
but if we hadn't used Lisp, we wouldn't have been
able to write the software that made them want to buy us.</span>

cause and effect.</span>

    The Cost of Being Average
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s272">
    How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?  
There is actually some data out there about that.
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s273">
    The most convenient measure of power is probably
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/power.html">
     code size
    </a>
    .</span>
<span class="s s274">The point of high-level
languages is to give you bigger abstractions-- bigger bricks,
as it were, so you don't need as many to build
a wall of a given size.</span>
<span class="s s275">So the more powerful
the language, the shorter the program (not simply in
characters, of course, but in distinct elements).</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s277">How does a more powerful language enable you to write
shorter programs?</span><span class="s s278">  One technique you can use, if the language will
let you, is something called
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/progbot.html">
     bottom-up programming
    </a>
    .</span>  <span class="s s279">Instead of
simply writing your application in the base language, you
build on top of the base language a language for writing
programs like yours, then write your program
in it.</span> <span class="s s280">The combined code can be much shorter than if you
had written your whole program in the base language-- indeed,
this is how most compression algorithms work.</span>
<span class="s s281">A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as well,  
because in many cases the language layer won't have to change
at all.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s283">Code size is important, because the time it takes
to write a program depends mostly on its length.</span>
<span class="s s284">If your program would be three times as long in another
language, it will take three times as long to write-- and
you can't get around this by hiring more people, because
beyond a certain size new hires are actually a net lose.</span><span class="s s285">
Fred Brooks described this phenomenon in his famous
book
    <i>
     The Mythical Man-Month,
    </i>
    and everything I've seen
has tended to confirm what he said.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s287">So how much shorter are your programs if you write them in
Lisp?</span>  <span class="s s288">Most of the numbers I've heard for Lisp
versus C, for example, have been around 7-10x.</span><span class="s s289">
But a recent article about ITA in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2286/new1015626014044/">
     <i>
      New
Architect
     </i>
    </a>
    magazine said that
"one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C," and since
this article was full of quotes from ITA's president, I
assume they got this number from ITA.</span>  <span class="s s290">If so then
we can put some faith in it; ITA's software includes a lot
of C and  C++ as well as Lisp, so they are speaking from
experience.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s292">My guess is that these multiples aren't even constant.</span>
<span class="s s293">I think they increase when
you face harder problems and also when you have smarter
programmers.</span>  <span class="s s294">A really good hacker can squeeze more
out of better tools.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s296">As one data point on the curve, at any rate,
if you were to compete with ITA and
chose to write your software in C, they would be able to develop
software twenty times faster than you.</span>
<span class="s s297">If you spent a year on a new feature, they'd be able to
duplicate it in less than three weeks.</span><span class="s s298">  Whereas if they spent
just three months developing something new, it would be
    <i>
     five years
    </i>
    before you had it too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s300">And you know what?</span>  <span class="s s301">That's the best-case scenario.</span>
<span class="s s302">When you talk about code-size ratios, you're implicitly assuming
that you can actually write the program in the weaker language.</span>
<span class="s s303">But in fact there are limits on what programmers can do.</span>
<span class="s s304">If you're trying to solve a hard problem with a language that's
too low-level, you reach a point where there is just too 
much to keep in your head at once.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s306">So when I say it would take ITA's imaginary
competitor five years to duplicate something ITA could
write in Lisp in three months, I mean five years
if nothing goes wrong.</span>  <span class="s s307">In fact, the way things work in 
most companies, any
development project that would take five years is
likely never to get finished at all.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s309">I admit this is an extreme case.</span>  <span class="s s310">ITA's hackers seem to
be unusually smart, and C is a pretty low-level language.</span>
<span class="s s311">But in a competitive market, even a differential of two or
three to one would
be enough to guarantee that you'd always be behind.</span>

    A Recipe
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s314">This is the kind of possibility that the pointy-haired boss
doesn't even want to think about.</span>  <span class="s s315">And so most of them don't.</span>
<span class="s s316">Because, you know, when it comes down to it, the pointy-haired
boss doesn't mind if his company gets their ass kicked, so
long as no one can prove it's his fault.</span>
<span class="s s317">The safest plan for him personally
is to stick close to the center of the herd.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s319">Within large organizations, the phrase used to
describe this approach is "industry best practice.</span><span class="s s320">"</span>
<span class="s s321">Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired
boss from responsibility: if he chooses
something that is "industry best practice," and the company
loses, he can't be blamed.</span>  <span class="s s322">He didn't choose, the industry did.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s324">I believe this term was originally used to describe
accounting methods and so on.</span><span class="s s325">  What it means, roughly,
is
    <i>
     don't do anything weird.
    </i>
    And in accounting that's
probably a good idea.</span>  <span class="s s326">The terms "cutting-edge" and  
"accounting" do not sound good together.</span>  <span class="s s327">But when you import
this criterion into decisions about technology, you start
to get the wrong answers.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s329">
    Technology often
    <i>
     should
    </i>
    be
cutting-edge.</span>  <span class="s s330">In programming languages, as Erann Gat
has pointed out, what "industry best practice"  actually
gets you is not the best, but merely the
average.</span>  <span class="s s331">When a decision causes you to develop software at
a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors,  
"best practice" is a misnomer.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s333">So here we have two pieces of information that I think are
very valuable.</span>  <span class="s s334">In fact, I know it from my own experience.</span>
<span class="s s335">Number 1, languages vary in power.</span>  <span class="s s336">Number 2, most managers
deliberately ignore this.</span>  <span class="s s337">Between them, these two facts
are literally a recipe for making money.</span>  <span class="s s338">ITA is an example
of this recipe in action.</span>
<span class="s s339">If you want to win in a software
business, just take on the hardest problem you can find,
use the most powerful language you can get, and wait for
your competitors' pointy-haired bosses to revert to the mean.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s341">
    Appendix: Power
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s342">As an illustration of what I mean about the relative power
of programming languages, consider the following problem.</span>
<span class="s s343">We want to write a function that generates accumulators-- a
function that takes a number n, and
returns a function that takes another number i and
returns n incremented by i.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s345">
    (That's
    <i>
     incremented by
    </i>
    , not plus.  An accumulator
has to accumulate.)
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s346">
    In Common Lisp this would be
    </span></p><xmp><span class="s s347">
     (defun foo (n)
  (lambda (i) (incf n i)))
    </span></xmp><span class="s s348">
    and in Perl 5,
    </span><xmp><span class="s s349">
     sub foo {  
  my ($n) = @_;
  sub {$n += shift}
}
    </span></xmp><span class="s s350">
    which has more elements than the Lisp version because
you have to extract parameters manually in Perl.
   
   </span><p><span class="s s351">
    In Smalltalk the code is slightly longer than in Lisp
    </span></p><xmp><span class="s s352">
     foo: n                              
  |s|                      
  s := n.                          
  ^[:i| s := s+i. ]
    </span></xmp><span class="s s353">
    because although in general lexical variables work, you can't
do an assignment to a parameter, so you have to create a
new variable s.
   
   </span><p><span class="s s354">
    In Javascript the example is, again, slightly longer, because 
Javascript retains
the distinction between statements and
expressions, so you need explicit
    </span><tt><span class="s s355">
     return
    </span></tt><span class="s s356">
    statements
to return values:
    </span></p><xmp><span class="s s357">
     function foo(n) { 
  return function (i) { 
           return n += i } }
    </span></xmp><span class="s s358">
    (To be fair, Perl also retains
this distinction, but deals with it in typical Perl fashion
by letting you omit
    </span><tt><span class="s s359">
     return
    </span></tt><span class="s s360">
    s.)
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s361">If you try to translate the Lisp/Perl/Smalltalk/Javascript code into 
Python you run into some limitations.</span>  <span class="s s362">Because Python
doesn't fully support lexical variables,
you have to create a data structure to hold the value of n.</span>
<span class="s s363">And although
Python does have a function data type, there is no
literal representation for one (unless the body is
only a single expression) so you need to create a named
function to return.</span>  <span class="s s364">This is what you end up with:</span>
    </p><xmp><span class="s s365">
     def foo(n):
  s = [n]
  def bar(i):
    s[0] += i
    return s[0] 
  return bar
    </span></xmp><span class="s s366">
    Python users might legitimately ask why they can't
just write
    </span><xmp><span class="s s367">
     def foo(n):
  return lambda i: return n += i
    </span></xmp><span class="s s368">
    or even
    </span><xmp><span class="s s369">
     def foo(n):
  lambda i: n += i
    </span></xmp><span class="s s370">
    and my guess is that they probably will, one day.
(But if they don't want to wait for Python to evolve the rest
of the way into Lisp, they could always just...)

Oscar, you will.")  -->
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s371">In OO languages, you can, to a limited extent, simulate
a closure (a function that refers to variables defined in
enclosing scopes) by defining a class with one method
and a field to replace each variable from an enclosing
scope.</span>  <span class="s s372">This makes the programmer do the kind of code
analysis that would be done by the compiler in a language
with full support for lexical scope, and it won't work
if more than one function refers to the same variable,
but it is enough in simple cases like this.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s374">
    Python experts seem to agree that this is the
preferred way to solve the problem in Python, writing
either
    </span></p><xmp>
     <span class="s s375">def foo(n):
  class acc:
    def __init__(self, s):
        self.</span><span class="s s376">s = s

      self.n = n
  def __call__(self, i):
      self.n += i
      return self.n
    </span></xmp><span class="s s382">
    I include these because I wouldn't want Python
advocates to say I was misrepresenting the language,   
but both seem to me more complex than the first   
version.  You're doing the same thing, setting up
a separate place to hold the accumulator; it's just
a field in an object instead of the head of a list.
And the use of these special,
reserved field names, especially
    </span><tt><span class="s s383">
     __call__
    </span></tt><span class="s s384">
    , seems
a bit of a hack.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s385">In the rivalry between Perl and Python, the claim of the
Python hackers seems to be that
that Python is a more elegant alternative to Perl, but what
this case shows is that power is the ultimate elegance:
the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if the
syntax is a bit uglier.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s387">How about other languages?</span> <span class="s s388">In the other languages
mentioned in this talk-- Fortran, C, C++, Java, and
Visual Basic-- it is not clear whether you can actually
solve this problem.</span>
<span class="s s389">Ken Anderson says that the following code is about as close
as you can get in Java:</span>
    </p><xmp><span class="s s390">
     public interface Inttoint {
  public int call(int i);
}
    </span></xmp><xmp>
     <span class="s s391">public static Inttoint foo(final int n) {
  return new Inttoint() {
    int s = n;
    public int call(int i) {
    s = s + i;
    return s;
    }};
}</span>
    </xmp><span class="s s392">
    This falls short of the spec because it only works for
integers.  After many email exchanges with Java hackers,
I would say that writing a properly polymorphic version
that behaves like the preceding examples is somewhere
between damned awkward and impossible.  If anyone wants to
write one I'd be very curious to see it, but I personally
have timed out.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s393">It's not literally true that you can't solve this
problem in other languages, of course.</span>  <span class="s s394">The fact
that all these languages are Turing-equivalent means
that, strictly speaking, you can write any program in
any of them.</span>  <span class="s s395">So how would you do it?</span>  <span class="s s396">In the limit case,
by writing a Lisp
interpreter in the less powerful language.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s398">That sounds like a joke, but it happens so often to
varying degrees in large programming projects that
there is a name for the phenomenon, Greenspun's Tenth
Rule:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s399">Any sufficiently
     complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc
     informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of
     Common Lisp.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s401">
    If you try to solve a
hard problem, the question is not whether you will use
a powerful enough language, but whether you will (a)
use a powerful language, (b) write a de facto interpreter
for one, or (c) yourself become a human compiler for one.
We see this already
begining to happen in the Python example, where we are
in effect simulating the code that a compiler
would generate to implement a lexical variable.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s402">This practice is not only common, but institutionalized.</span>  <span class="s s403">For example,
in the OO world you hear a good deal about 
"patterns".</span>
<span class="s s404">I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c),
the human compiler, at work.</span>  <span class="s s405">When I see patterns in my programs,
I consider it a sign of trouble.</span>  <span class="s s406">The shape of a program
should reflect only the problem it needs to solve.</span>
<span class="s s407">Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at
least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful
enough-- often that I'm generating by hand the
expansions of some macro that I need to write.</span>
