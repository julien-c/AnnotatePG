   Founder Control

    December 2010
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">Someone we funded is talking to VCs now, and asked me how common
it was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board after
a series A round.</span>  <span class="s s4">He said VCs told him this almost never happened.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s6">Ten years ago that was true.</span>  <span class="s s7">In the past, founders rarely kept
control of the board through a series A.</span>  <span class="s s8">The traditional series A
board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.</span>
<span class="s s9">More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one
independent.</span>  <span class="s s10">In either case the founders lose their majority.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">But not always.</span>  <span class="s s13">Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board
through the series A and still has it today.</span>  <span class="s s14">Mark Pincus has kept
control of Zynga's too.</span>  <span class="s s15">But are these just outliers?</span>  <span class="s s16">How common
is it for founders to keep control after an A round?</span>  <span class="s s17">I'd heard of
several cases among the companies we've funded, but I wasn't sure
how many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s19">The replies surprised me.</span>  <span class="s s20">In a dozen companies we've funded, the
founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series
A round.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s22">I feel like we're at a tipping point here.</span>  <span class="s s23">A lot of VCs still act
as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.</span>
<span class="s s24">A lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask&mdash;as if
you're a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing.</span>  <span class="s s25">But the
founders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks.</span>  <span class="s s26">Or if they
are, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control
freaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.</span>
<span class="s s29">And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it
will become the norm.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s31">Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply
outvoting other parties in board meetings.</span>  <span class="s s32">Investors usually get
vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless
of how many board seats they have.</span>  <span class="s s33">And board votes are rarely
split.</span>  <span class="s s34">Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote,
not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous.</span>  <span class="s s35">But if opinion
is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose
in a vote will tend to be less insistent.</span>  <span class="s s36">That's what board control
means in practice.</span>  <span class="s s37">You don't simply get to do whatever you want;
the board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; but
if you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion about
what's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s39">So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary
either.</span>  <span class="s s40">There's inevitably a difference in how things feel within
the company.</span>  <span class="s s41">Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to
retain board control after a series A, that will change the way
things feel in the whole startup world.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s43">The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the
startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.</span>  <span class="s s44">They're
the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s46">A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups
is that they're embarrassed to go back to their partners looking
like they got beaten.</span>  <span class="s s47">When they sign a termsheet, they want to be
able to brag about the good terms they got.</span>  <span class="s s48">A lot of them don't
care that much personally about whether founders keep board control.</span>
<span class="s s49">They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions.</span>
<span class="s s50">Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived
as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s52">Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this change
won't turn out to be as big a problem as they might think.</span> <span class="s s53">VCs will
still be able to convince; they just won't be able to compel.</span>  <span class="s s54">And
the startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not the
ones that matter anyway.</span>  <span class="s s55">VCs make most of their money from a few
big hits, and those aren't them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s57">Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help
VCs pick better.</span>  <span class="s s58">If they know they can't fire the founders, they'll
have to choose founders they can trust.</span>  <span class="s s59">And that's who they should
have been choosing all along.</span>
