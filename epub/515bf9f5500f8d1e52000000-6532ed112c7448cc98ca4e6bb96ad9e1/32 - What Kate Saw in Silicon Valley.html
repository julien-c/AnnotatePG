   What Kate Saw in Silicon Valley
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   August 2009
  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">Kate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator's office.</span>
<span class="s s4">Recently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she's not
busy with architectural projects.</span>  <span class="s s5">Though she'd heard a lot about
YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">I've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal
to me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about
it.</span>  <span class="s s8">This was her list:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s9">
   1. How many startups fail.
   Kate knew in principle that startups
were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the
threat of failure was&acirc;&#128;&#148;not just for the minnows, but even for the
famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.
   </span><h3><span class="s s10">
    2. How much startups' ideas change.
    As usual, by Demo Day about
half the startups were doing something significantly different than
they started with.  We encourage that.  Starting a startup is like
science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads.  In
the rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure
what they want to do, and once started they tend continue on their
initial path even if it's mistaken.
    </span><h3><span class="s s11">
     3. How little money it can take to start a startup.
     In Kate's
world, everything is still physical and expensive.  You can barely
renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.
     </span><h3>
      <span class="s s12">4.</span> <span class="s s13">How scrappy founders are.</span>
      <span class="s s14">That was her actual word.</span>  <span class="s s15">I agree
with her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how
little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.</span>
<span class="s s16">It wouldn't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone
scrappy.</span>
      </h3></h3></h3></h3><p>
       <span class="s s18">What does it mean, exactly?</span>  <span class="s s19">It's basically the diminutive form of
belligerent.</span>  <span class="s s20">Someone who's scrappy manages to be both threatening
and undignified at the same time.</span>   <span class="s s21">Which seems to me exactly what
one would want to be, in any kind of work.</span>  <span class="s s22">If you're not threatening,
you're probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely a
sort of plaque.</span>
      </p>
      <h3><span class="s s24">
       5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.
       "It seems like everybody
here is in the industry."  That isn't literally true, but there is
a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.
You tend to keep your voice down, because there's a good chance the
person at the next table would know some of the people you're talking
about.  I never felt that in Boston.  The good news is, there's
also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in
some way.
       </span><h3>
        <span class="s s25">6.</span> <span class="s s26">That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.</span>
        <span class="s s27">Actually, I've noticed this too.</span>  <span class="s s28">I always worry the speakers will
put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the
startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.</span>
        </h3></h3><p>
         <span class="s s30">When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always
saying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something
fast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required
resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and
that most VCs were sheep.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s32">I've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate
launching fast and iterating.</span>  <span class="s s33">That was contrarian advice 10 years
ago, but it's clearly now the established practice.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>
         <span class="s s35">7.</span> <span class="s s36">How casual successful startup founders are.</span>
         <span class="s s37">Most of the famous
founders in Silicon Valley are people you'd overlook on the street.</span>
<span class="s s38">It's not merely that they don't dress up.</span>  <span class="s s39">They don't project any
kind of aura of power either.</span>  <span class="s s40">"They're not trying to impress
anyone.</span><span class="s s41">"</span>
         </h3><p>
          <span class="s s43">Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out
successful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way they
dressed and the way they carried themselves.</span>
         </p>
         <h3><span class="s s45">
          8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.
          (I swear I didn't prompt this one.)  Without advice "they'd just
be sort of lost."  Fortunately, there are a lot of people to help
them.  There's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded
startups.  But we didn't invent that idea: it's just a slightly
more concentrated form of existing Valley culture.
          </span><h3>
           <span class="s s46">9.</span> <span class="s s47">What a solitary task startups are.</span>
           <span class="s s48">Architects are constantly
interacting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology
startup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted
time to work.</span>  <span class="s s49">"You could do it in a box.</span><span class="s s50">"</span>
           </h3></h3><p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <span class="s s52">By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the "normal" world.</span>
<span class="s s53">It's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they
work slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projects
whose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjust
their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.</span>
           </p>
           <p>
            <span class="s s55">That's also a fairly accurate description of the past.</span>  <span class="s s56">So startup
culture may not merely be different in the way you'd expect any
subculture to be, but a leading indicator.</span>
