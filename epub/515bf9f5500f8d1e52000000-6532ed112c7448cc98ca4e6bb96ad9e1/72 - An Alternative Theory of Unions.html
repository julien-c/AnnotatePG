    An Alternative Theory of Unions

   <p>
    <span class="s s3">People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor
generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.</span>
<span class="s s4">In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing
jobs that boosted the median income.</span>  <span class="s s5">I wouldn't quite call the
high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it
are reading too much into it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s7">Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize
where the high-paying union job came from.</span>  <span class="s s8">In a rapidly growing
market, you don't worry too much about efficiency.</span>  <span class="s s9">It's more
important to grow fast.</span>  <span class="s s10">If there's some mundane problem getting
in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive,
just take it and get on with more important things.</span>  <span class="s s11">EBay didn't
win by paying less for servers than their competitors.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s13">Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a
growth industry in the mid twentieth century.</span>  <span class="s s14">This was an era when
small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting
consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and
huge economies of scale.</span>  <span class="s s15">You had to grow fast or die.</span>  <span class="s s16">Workers
were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.</span>
<span class="s s17">A reliable supply was more important than low cost.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s19">If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude
must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as
the new model isn't delayed.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was
worth.</span>  <span class="s s22">Circumstances being what they were, companies would have
been stupid to insist on paying them so little.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s24">If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask
anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the
Internet Bubble.</span>  <span class="s s25">In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums
of money for building the most trivial things.</span>  <span class="s s26">And yet does anyone
who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?</span>  <span class="s s27">I
doubt it.</span>  <span class="s s28">Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary
aberration.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration, 
just spread
over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology
that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they
would something like consulting during the Bubble.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s32">
    Basically, unions were just Razorfish.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union
organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now?</span>
<span class="s s34">The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of
people living in fallen civilizations.</span>  <span class="s s35">Our ancestors were giants.</span>
<span class="s s36">The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral
courage that's lacking today.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s38">In fact there's a simpler explanation.</span>  <span class="s s39">The early twentieth century
was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure.</span>  <span class="s s40">And
we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned
whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying
union job.</span>  <span class="s s41">We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies
overspend on different things.</span>
