   Startup = Growth
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">

  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">A startup is a company designed to grow fast.</span>  <span class="s s4">Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup.</span>  <span class="s s5">Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of "exit.</span><span class="s s6">"</span>  <span class="s s7">The only essential thing is growth.</span>
<span class="s s8">Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">If you want to start one it's important to understand that.</span> <span class="s s11">Startups
are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to
succeed.</span>  <span class="s s12">You have to know that growth is what you're after.</span>  <span class="s s13">The
good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into
place.</span>  <span class="s s14">Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost
every decision you face.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s16">
   Redwoods
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often
overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.</span>  <span class="s s18">Millions
of companies are started every year in the US.</span>  <span class="s s19">Only a tiny fraction
are startups.</span>  <span class="s s20">Most are service businesses&mdash;restaurants, barbershops,
plumbers, and so on.</span>  <span class="s s21">These are not startups, except in a few unusual
cases.</span>  <span class="s s22">A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast.</span>  <span class="s s23">Whereas a search
engine, for example, is.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s25">When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two
senses.</span>  <span class="s s26">Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because
most startups fail.</span>  <span class="s s27">But I also mean startups are different by
nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny
from a bean sprout.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s29">That difference is why there's a distinct word, "startup," for
companies designed to grow fast.</span>  <span class="s s30">If all companies were essentially
similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders
ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word.</span>  <span class="s s31">We
could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful
ones.</span>  <span class="s s32">But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from
other businesses.</span>  <span class="s s33">Google is not just a barbershop whose founders
were unusually lucky and hard-working.</span>  <span class="s s34">Google was different from
the beginning.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s36">To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big
market.</span>  <span class="s s37">That's the difference between Google and a barbershop.</span>  <span class="s s38">A
barbershop doesn't scale.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s40">For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots
of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.</span>  <span class="s s41">Barbershops
are doing fine in the (a) department.</span>  <span class="s s42">Almost everyone needs their
hair cut.</span>  <span class="s s43">The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail
establishment, is (b).</span>  <span class="s s44">A barbershop serves customers in person,
and few will travel far for a haircut.</span>  <span class="s s45">And even if they did the
barbershop couldn't accomodate them.</span><span class="s s46">[<a name="f1" href="#f1n">1</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s47">Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end
up constrained in (a).</span>  <span class="s s48">If you write software to teach Tibetan to
Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who
want it, but there won't be many of them.</span>   <span class="s s49">If you make software
to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup
territory.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s51">
   Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctive
feature of successful startups is that they're not.
  </span></p>
  <h3><span class="s s52">
   Ideas
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s53">It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup
than an ordinary business.</span>  <span class="s s54">If you're going to start a company, why
not start the type with the most potential?</span>  <span class="s s55">The catch is that this
is a (fairly) efficient market.</span>   <span class="s s56">If you write software to teach
Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition.</span>  <span class="s s57">If you
write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face
ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize.</span><span class="s s58">[<a name="f2" href="#f2n">2</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s59">The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.</span>
<span class="s s60">That's the tradeoff.</span>  <span class="s s61">If you start a barbershop, you only have to
compete with other local barbers.</span>  <span class="s s62">If you start a search engine you
have to compete with the whole world.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s64">The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business
protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of
coming up with new ideas.</span>  <span class="s s65">If you open a bar in a particular
neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you
from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your
company.</span>  <span class="s s66">Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small
business.</span>  <span class="s s67">Similarly for companies constrained in (a).</span>  <span class="s s68">Your niche
both protects and defines you.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s70">Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to
have to think of something fairly novel.</span>  <span class="s s71">A startup has to make
something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type
are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s73">That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup
generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.</span>
<span class="s s74">I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to
find ideas everyone else has overlooked.</span>  <span class="s s75">But that's not how most
startups get started.</span>  <span class="s s76">Usually successful startups happen because
the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas
few others can see seem obvious to them.</span>  <span class="s s77">Perhaps later they step
back and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot,
and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there.</span><span class="s s78">[<a name="f3" href="#f3n">3</a>]
But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the
innovation is unconscious.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s80">What's different about successful founders is that they can see
different problems.  It's a particularly good combination both to
be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by
it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas
often become good without anyone noticing.</span>  <span class="s s81">Steve Wozniak's problem
was that he wanted his own computer.</span>  <span class="s s82">That was an unusual problem
to have in 1975.</span>  <span class="s s83">But technological change was about to make it a
much more common one.</span>  <span class="s s84">Because he not only wanted a computer but
knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.</span>  <span class="s s85">And
the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for
millions of people in the coming years.</span>  <span class="s s86">But by the time it was
obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was
already established.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s88">Google has similar origins.</span>  <span class="s s89">Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to
search the web.</span>  <span class="s s90">But unlike most people they had the technical
expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as
good as they could be, and to know how to improve them.</span>  <span class="s s91">Over the
next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web
grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert
to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough.</span>  <span class="s s92">But as happened
with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search
was, Google was entrenched.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s94">That's one connection between startup ideas and technology.</span>  <span class="s s95">Rapid
change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.</span>
<span class="s s96">Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.</span>
<span class="s s97">That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip
technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could
afford.</span>  <span class="s s98">But in Google's case the most important change was the
growth of the web.</span> <span class="s s99">What changed there was not solubility but bigness.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s101">The other connection between startups and technology is that startups
create new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,
in the broader sense of the word, new technology.</span>  
<span class="s s102">When a startup both begins with an
idea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting
of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called "high
technology"), it's easy to conflate the two.</span>  <span class="s s103">But the two connections
are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was
neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted
of technology except in the broader sense.</span><span class="s s104">[<a name="f4" href="#f4n">4</a>]
  </span></p>
  <h3><span class="s s105">
   Rate
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s106">How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?</span>
<span class="s s107">There's no precise answer to that.</span>  <span class="s s108">"Startup" is a pole, not a
threshold.</span>  <span class="s s109">Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of
one's ambitions.</span>  <span class="s s110">You're committing not just to starting a company,
but to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to
search for one of the rare ideas of that type.</span>  <span class="s s111">But at first you
have no more than commitment.</span>  <span class="s s112">Starting a startup is like being an
actor in that respect.</span>  <span class="s s113">"Actor" too is a pole rather than a threshold.</span>
<span class="s s114">At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to
auditions.</span>  <span class="s s115">Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't
only become an actor when he's successful.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s117">So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a
startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.</span>
<span class="s s118">For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's
equivalent to asking if they're on the right path.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s120">
   The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:
 </span></p>
   <ol><li><span class="s s121">
       There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup
    tries to figure out what it's doing.
      </span></li>   
     <li>
      <span class="s s122">As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people
    want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid
    growth.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span class="s s124">Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.</span>
    <span class="s s125">Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because
    the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the
    markets it serves.</span><span class="s s126">[<a name="f5" href="#f5n">5</a>]
     </span></li>
  </ol><p>
   <span class="s s127">Together these three phases produce an S-curve.</span>  <span class="s s128">The phase whose
growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.</span>  <span class="s s129">Its
length and slope determine how big the company will be.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s131">The slope is the company's growth rate.</span>  <span class="s s132">If there's one number every
founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate.</span>  <span class="s s133">That's
the measure of a startup.</span>  <span class="s s134">If you don't know that number, you don't
even know if you're doing well or badly.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s136">When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,
sometimes they tell me "we get about a hundred new customers a
month.</span><span class="s s137">"</span>  <span class="s s138">That's not a rate.</span>  <span class="s s139">What matters is not the absolute number
of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.</span>
<span class="s s140">If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every
month, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is
decreasing.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s142">During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because
there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups
early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what
they're doing.</span><span class="s s143">[<a name="f6" href="#f6n">6</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s144">A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.</span>  <span class="s s145">If you can hit 10% a
week you're doing exceptionally well.</span>  <span class="s s146">If you can only manage 1%,
it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s148">The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.</span>  <span class="s s149">The next
best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users.</span>
<span class="s s150">That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the
startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably
be a constant multiple of active users.</span><span class="s s151">[<a name="f7" href="#f7n">7</a>]
  </span></p>
  <h3><span class="s s152">
   Compass
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s153">We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they
can hit, and then just try to hit it every week.</span>  <span class="s s154">The key word here
is "just.</span><span class="s s155">"</span> <span class="s s156">If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that
number, they're successful for that week.</span>  <span class="s s157">There's nothing more
they need to do.</span>  <span class="s s158">But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the
only thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s160">Programmers will recognize what we're doing here.</span>  <span class="s s161">We're turning
starting a startup into an optimization problem.</span>  <span class="s s162">And anyone who
has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort
of narrow focus can be.</span>  <span class="s s163">Optimizing code means taking an existing
program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or
memory.</span>  <span class="s s164">You don't have to think about what the program should do,
just make it faster.</span>  <span class="s s165">For most programmers this is very satisfying
work.</span>  <span class="s s166">The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're
generally surprised how fast you can solve it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s168">Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly
multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.</span>
<span class="s s169">You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for
you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.</span>
<span class="s s170">Should you spend two days at a conference?</span>  <span class="s s171">Should you hire another
programmer?</span>  <span class="s s172">Should you focus more on marketing?</span>  <span class="s s173">Should you spend
time courting some big customer?</span>  <span class="s s174">Should you add x feature?</span> <span class="s s175">Whatever
gets you your target growth rate.</span><span class="s s176"> [<a name="f8" href="#f8n">8</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s177">Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more
than a week ahead.</span>  <span class="s s178">Once you experience the pain of missing your
target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed
at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such
pain in the future.</span>  <span class="s s179">So you'll be willing for example to hire another
programmer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps
in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you
more users.</span>   <span class="s s180">But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone
won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're
sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers
without hiring someone new.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s182">
   It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think
about it no more than necessary.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s183">In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into
trouble.</span>  <span class="s s184">They could end up on a local maximum.</span>  <span class="s s185">But in practice
that never happens.</span>  <span class="s s186">Having to hit a growth number every week forces
founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of
succeeding.</span>  <span class="s s187">Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is
just a form of procrastination.</span>  <span class="s s188">Whereas founders' intuitions about
which hill to climb are usually better than they realize.</span>  <span class="s s189">Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.</span>
<span class="s s190">Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s192">The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can
actually discover startup ideas.</span>  <span class="s s193">You can use the need for growth
as a form of evolutionary pressure.</span>  <span class="s s194">If you start out with some
initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%
weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than
you meant to start.</span>  <span class="s s195">But anything that grows consistently at 10% a
week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s197">There's a parallel here to small businesses.</span>  <span class="s s198">Just as the constraint
of being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,
the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a
startup.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s200">You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads
rather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a
scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather
than being influenced by what he wishes were the case.</span>  <span class="s s201">When Richard
Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the
imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the
truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made
up.</span> <span class="s s202">For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth.</span> <span class="s s203">Every
successful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination
of growth.</span><span class="s s204">[<a name="f9" href="#f9n">9</a>]

  <h3><span class="s s205">
   Value
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s206">It's hard to find something that grows consistently at several
percent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly
valuable.</span>  <span class="s s207">If we project forward we see why.</span>

   <p>
    <span class="s s226">Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential
growth, because our intutitions are no guide here.</span>  <span class="s s227">What happens
to fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s229">Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different
outcomes.</span>  <span class="s s230">That's why there's a separate word for startups, and why
startups do things that ordinary companies don't, like raising money
and getting acquired.</span>  <span class="s s231">And, strangely enough, it's also why they
fail so frequently.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s233">Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone
familiar with the concept of expected value would be surprised if
the failure rate weren't high.</span>  <span class="s s234">If a successful startup could make
a founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding were
only 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million.</span>
<span class="s s235">And the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determined
founders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%.</span>
<span class="s s236">For the right people&mdash;e.</span><span class="s s237">g.</span> <span class="s s238">the young Bill Gates&mdash;the probability
might be 20% or even 50%.</span>  <span class="s s239">So it's not surprising that so many want
to take a shot at it.</span>  <span class="s s240">In an efficient market, the number of failed
startups should be proportionate to the size of the successes.</span>  <span class="s s241">And
since the latter is huge the former should be too.</span><span class="s s242">[<a name="f11" href="#f11n">11</a>]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s243">What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of
startups will be working on something that's never going to go
anywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose
title of "startup.</span><span class="s s244">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s246">This doesn't bother me.</span>  <span class="s s247">It's the same with other high-beta vocations,
like being an actor or a novelist.</span>  <span class="s s248">I've long since gotten used to
it.</span>  <span class="s s249">But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those
who've started ordinary businesses.</span>  <span class="s s250">Many are annoyed that these
so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them
will amount to anything.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s252">If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be
less indignant.</span>  <span class="s s253">The mistake they're making is that by basing their
opinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the
median rather than the average.</span>  <span class="s s254">If you judge by the median startup,
the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.</span>  <span class="s s255">You have to
invent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or
investors want to fund them.</span>  <span class="s s256">But it's a mistake to use the median
in a domain with so much variation.</span>  <span class="s s257">If you look at the average
outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors
like them, and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational
choice for founders to start them.</span>

   <p>
    <span class="s s260">Why do investors like startups so much?</span>  <span class="s s261">Why are they so hot to
invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making
businesses?</span>  <span class="s s262">Not only for the obvious reason.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s264">The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.</span>  <span class="s s265">Startups
pass that test because although they're appallingly risky, the
returns when they do succeed are so high.</span>  <span class="s s266">But that's not the only
reason investors like startups.</span>  <span class="s s267">An ordinary slower-growing business
might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were
lower.</span>  <span class="s s268">So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies?</span>
<span class="s s269">The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back,
ideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it's acquired.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s271">The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of
dividends.</span>  <span class="s s272">Why isn't there a parallel VC industry that invests in
ordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits?</span>
<span class="s s273">Because it's too easy for people who control a private company to
funnel its revenues to themselves (e.</span><span class="s s274">g.</span> <span class="s s275">by buying overpriced
components from a supplier they control) while making it look like
the company is making little profit.</span>  <span class="s s276">Anyone who invested in private
companies in return for dividends would have to pay close attention
to their books.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s278">The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns,
but also because such investments are so easy to oversee.</span>  <span class="s s279">The
founders can't enrich themselves without also enriching the investors.</span><span class="s s280">[<a name="f12" href="#f12n">12</a>]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s281">Why do founders want to take the VCs' money?</span>  <span class="s s282">Growth, again.</span>  <span class="s s283">The
constraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions.</span>
<span class="s s284">It's not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow.</span>  <span class="s s285">If you have
such an idea and don't grow fast enough, competitors will.</span>  <span class="s s286">Growing
too slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network
effects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s288">Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started.</span>
<span class="s s289">But startups often raise money even when they are or could be
profitable.</span>  <span class="s s290">It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable
company for less than you think it will later be worth, but it's
no more foolish than buying insurance.</span>  <span class="s s291">Fundamentally that's how
the most successful startups view fundraising.</span>  <span class="s s292">They could grow the
company on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied
by VCs will let them grow even faster.</span><span class="s s293">  Raising money lets you <i>choose</i> 
your growth rate.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s295">Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful
startups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs.</span>
<span class="s s296">A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues.</span>
<span class="s s297">Growing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are it
wouldn't kill them.</span>  <span class="s s298">Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and
in particular the most successful startups, or they'll be out of
business.</span>  <span class="s s299">Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will
be offered money on terms they'd be crazy to refuse.</span>  <span class="s s300">And yet because
of the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can still
make money from such investments.</span>  <span class="s s301">You'd have to be crazy to believe
your company was going to become as valuable as a high growth rate
can make it, but some do.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s303">Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers
too.</span>  <span class="s s304">Why?</span>  <span class="s s305">What is it about startups that makes other companies
want to buy them?</span><span class="s s306"> [<a name="f13" href="#f13n">13</a>]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s307">Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock
of successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable.</span>  <span class="s s308">It's
a good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now
responsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s310">But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups.</span>  <span class="s s311">A rapidly
growing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s312">If it keeps
expanding, it might expand into the acquirer's own territory.</span>  <span class="s s313">Most
product acquisitions have some component of fear.</span>  <span class="s s314">Even if an
acquirer isn't threatened by the startup itself, they might be
alarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it.</span>  <span class="s s315">And
because startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers,
acquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would.</span><span class="s s316">[<a name="f14" href="#f14n">14</a>]

   <h3><span class="s s317">
    Understand
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s318">The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural
ecosystem.</span>  <span class="s s319">It works so well that those who don't understand it are
driven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things
sometimes turn out.</span>  <span class="s s320">Just as our ancestors did to explain the
apparently too neat workings of the natural world.</span>  <span class="s s321">But there is
no secret cabal making it all work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s323">If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was
worthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerberg
to buy it.</span>  <span class="s s324">To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg that is the reductio
ad absurdum of the initial assumption.</span>  <span class="s s325">The reason he bought Instagram
was that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was
growth.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s327">If you want to understand startups, understand growth.</span>  <span class="s s328">Growth
drives everything in this world.</span>  <span class="s s329">Growth is why startups usually
work on technology&mdash;because ideas for fast growing companies are
so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those
recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source
of rapid change.</span>  <span class="s s330">Growth is why it's a rational choice economically
for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the
successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high
even though the risk is too.</span>  <span class="s s331">Growth is why VCs want to invest in
startups: not just because the returns are high but also because
generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than
generating returns from dividends.</span>  <span class="s s332">Growth explains why the most
successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it
lets them choose their growth rate.</span>  <span class="s s333">And growth explains why
successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers.</span>  <span class="s s334">To
acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous
too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s336">It's not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have
to understand the forces driving it.</span><span class="s s337">  Understanding growth is what
starting a startup <i>consists</i> of.</span>  <span class="s s338">What you're really doing (and
to the dismay of some observers, all you're really doing) when you
start a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem
than ordinary businesses do.</span>  <span class="s s339">You're committing to search for one
of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.</span>  <span class="s s340">Because these ideas
are so valuable, finding one is hard.</span>  <span class="s s341">The startup is the embodiment
of your discoveries so far.</span>  <span class="s s342">Starting a startup is thus very much
like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to
solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems
are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no
one knew before.</span>  <span class="s s343">A startup founder is in effect an economic research
scientist.</span>  <span class="s s344">Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some
discover relativity.</span>

Strictly speaking it's not lots of customers you need but a big

much they'll pay.</span>  <span class="s s348">But it's dangerous to have too few customers
even if they pay a lot, or the power that individual customers have

That sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at

I got it wrong in <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">"How to Make Wealth"</a>

In principle companies aren't limited by the size of the markets
they serve, because they could just expand into new markets.</span>  <span class="s s364">But
there seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that.</span>
<span class="s s365">Which means the slowdown that comes from bumping up against the
limits of one's markets is ultimately just another way in which
internal limits are expressed.</span>
   </p>

    It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing
the shape of the organization&mdash;specifically by sharding it.

This is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched
or can launch during YC.</span>  <span class="s s369">A startup building a new database will
probably not do that.</span>  <span class="s s370">On the other hand, launching something small
and then using growth rate as evolutionary pressure is such a
valuable technique that any company that could start this way
probably should.</span>

If the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building
something they hope will be very popular but from which they don't
yet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be
higher, even though it's a proxy for revenue growth, because such
companies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s374">Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the
churn is high as well, so that you have good net growth till you run
through all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.</span>

Within YC when we say it's ipso facto right to do whatever gets
you growth, it's implicit that this excludes trickery like buying
users for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active
when they're really not, bleeding out invites at a regularly
increasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc.</span>  <span class="s s377">Even

Which is why it's such a dangerous mistake to believe that
successful startups are simply the embodiment of some brilliant
initial idea.</span>  <span class="s s380">What you're looking for initially is not so much a
great idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one.</span>   <span class="s s381">The
danger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of
great ones.</span>  <span class="s s382">They're often different in kind, because the early
adopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the
rest of the market.</span>  <span class="s s383">For example, the idea that evolves into Facebook
isn't merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into
Facebook is a site for Harvard undergrads.</span>
