  <p>
   <span class="s s3">I'm not a very good speaker.</span>  <span class="s s4">I say "um" a lot.</span> <span class="s s5">Sometimes I have
to pause when I lose my train of thought.</span>  <span class="s s6">I wish I were a better
speaker.</span>  <span class="s s7">But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I
were a better writer.</span>  <span class="s s8">What I really want is to have good ideas,
and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a
good speaker.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">Having good ideas is most of writing well.</span>  <span class="s s11">If you know what you're
talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be
perceived as having a good style.</span>  <span class="s s12">With speaking it's the opposite:
having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good
speaker.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">I first noticed this at a conference several years ago.</span>
<span class="s s15">There was another speaker who was much better than me.</span>
<span class="s s16">He had all of us roaring with laughter.</span>  <span class="s s17">I seemed awkward and
halting by comparison.</span>  <span class="s s18">Afterward I put my talk online like I usually
do.</span>  <span class="s s19">As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the
other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he
hadn't said very much.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about
speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered
in speaking than writing.</span><span class="s s22">[<a name="f1" href="#f1n">1</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s23">A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a
better speaker than me, but a famous speaker.</span>  <span class="s s24">Boy was he good.</span>  <span class="s s25">So
I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he
did it.</span>  <span class="s s26">After about ten sentences I found myself thinking "I don't
want to be a good speaker.</span><span class="s s27">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s29">Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,
but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.</span>  <span class="s s30">For example,
when I give a talk I usually write it out beforehand.</span><span class="s s31">  I know that's
a mistake; I know delivering a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">
    prewritten</a> talk makes it harder to
engage with an audience.</span><span class="s s32">  The way to get the attention of an audience
is to give them <i>your</i> full attention, and when you're delivering
a prewritten talk your attention is always divided between the
audience and the talk-even if you've memorized it.</span><span class="s s33">  If you want
to engage an audience it's better to start with no more than an outline
of what you want to say and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmG9jzCHtSQ">ad lib
</a> the individual sentences.</span>  <span class="s s34">But if you do that you could spend no more time thinking about each
sentence than it takes to say it.</span><span class="s s35">[<a name="f2" href="#f2n">2</a>] Occasionally the stimulation
of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but
in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing
does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.</span>    
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s37">If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get
asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking
ad lib.</span>  <span class="s s38">Actors do.</span>  <span class="s s39">But here again there's a tradeoff between
smoothness and ideas.</span>  <span class="s s40">All the time you spend practicing a talk,
you could instead spend making it better.</span>  <span class="s s41">Actors don't face
that temptation except in the rare cases where they've written the
script, but any speaker does.</span>  <span class="s s42">Before I give a talk I can usually
be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on
paper, trying to rehearse it in my head.</span>  <span class="s s43">But I always end up
spending most of the time rewriting it instead.</span>  <span class="s s44">Every talk I give
ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out
and rewritten.</span>  <span class="s s45">Which of course makes me um even more, because I
haven't had any time at all to practice the new bits.</span><span class="s s46">[<a name="f3" href="#f3n">3</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s47">Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than
these.</span>  <span class="s s48">Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like
to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.</span>  <span class="s s49">As you
decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is
increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.</span>  <span class="s s50">That's true in
writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.</span>  <span class="s s51">Any
given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.</span>
<span class="s s52">Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about
each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can
only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear
it.</span>  <span class="s s53">Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions
of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to
person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort,
just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones.</span>  <span class="s s54">Every
audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.</span>  <span class="s s55">Part
of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at
that conference was that everyone else did.</span><span class="s s56">[<a name="f4" href="#f4n">4</a>]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s57">So are talks useless?</span>  <span class="s s58">They're certainly inferior to the written
word as a source of ideas.</span>  <span class="s s59">But that's not all talks are good for.</span>
<span class="s s60">When I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the
speaker.</span>  <span class="s s61">Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to
having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't
have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet
him.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s63">Talks are also good at motivating me to do things.</span>  <span class="s s64">It's probably
no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as
motivational speakers.</span>  <span class="s s65">That may be what public speaking is really
for.</span>  <span class="s s66">It's probably what it was originally for.</span>  <span class="s s67">The emotional
reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force.</span>
<span class="s s68">I wish I could say that force was more often used for good than
ill, but I'm not sure.</span>
  </p>  
  <h3><span class="s s70">
   Notes
  </span></h3>
  <p><span class="s s71">
   [<a href="#f1" name="f1n">1</a>]
I'm not talking here about academic talks, which are a 
different type of thing.</span>  <span class="s s72">While the
audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or
at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas
you're presenting.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s74">
   [<a href="#f2" name="f2n">2</a>]
That's the lower bound.</span>  <span class="s s75">In practice you can often do better,
because talks are usually about things you've written or talked
about before, and when you ad lib you end up reproducing some of
those sentences.</span>  <span class="s s76">Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks
are made of spolia.</span>  <span class="s s77">Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally,
because you have to deliver these sentences as if you'd just thought
of them.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s79">
   [<a href="#f3" name="f3n">3</a>]
Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing
talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward
parts.</span>  <span class="s s80">I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at
least once for that reason.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s82">
   [<a href="#f4" name="f4n">4</a>]
For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being
part of an audience makes people dumber.</span>  <span class="s s83">The real decline seems
to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like
a conversation-maybe around 10 people.</span>

   Thanks
   to Sam Altman and Robert Morris for reading drafts
of this.
