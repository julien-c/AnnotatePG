   What We Look for in Founders

      (I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something
about the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cut
the last item because they didn't have room.)
     </i>
    </span></p>
    <h3><span class="s s4">
     1. Determination
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s5">This has turned out to be the most important quality in startup
founders.</span>  <span class="s s6">We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most
important quality would be intelligence.</span>  <span class="s s7">That's the myth in the
Valley.</span> <span class="s s8">And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.</span>  <span class="s s9">But
as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what
matters most is determination.</span>  <span class="s s10">You're going to hit a lot of
obstacles.</span><span class="s s11">  You can't be the sort of person who gets
     <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/die.html">
      demoralized
     </a>
     easily.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s13">
     Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of
     <a target="_blank" href="http://wepay.com">
      WePay
     </a>
     are a good example.</span>  <span class="s s14">They're
doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,
bureaucratic companies.</span>  <span class="s s15">When you're starting a startup that depends
on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're
trying to ignore you out of existence.</span>  <span class="s s16">But when Bill Clerico starts
calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not
going away.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s18">
     2. Flexibility
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s19">You do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases
like "don't give up on your dreams."</span>  <span class="s s20">The world of startups is so
unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the
fly.</span><span class="s s21">  The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination
and flexibility you need is a
     <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/relres.html">
      running back
     </a>
     .</span>  
<span class="s s22">He's determined to get
downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or
even backwards to get there.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s24">
     The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of
     <a target="_blank" href="http://greplin.com">
      Greplin
     </a>
     .</span>  <span class="s s25">He applied to YC with 
some bad ecommerce idea.</span>  <span class="s s26">We told
him we'd fund him if he did something else.</span>  <span class="s s27">He thought for a second,
and said ok.</span>  <span class="s s28">He then went through two more ideas before settling
on Greplin.</span>  <span class="s s29">He'd only been working on it for a couple days when
he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.</span>
<span class="s s30">He always seems to land on his feet.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s32">
     3. Imagination
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s33">Intelligence does matter a lot of course.</span>  <span class="s s34">It seems like the type
that matters most is imagination.</span>  <span class="s s35">It's not so important to be able
to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with
surprising new ideas.</span><span class="s s36">  In the startup world, most good ideas
     <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/googles.html">
      seem
bad
     </a>
     initially.</span>  <span class="s s37">If they were obviously good, someone would already
be doing them.</span>  <span class="s s38">So you need the kind of intelligence that produces
ideas with just the right level of craziness.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s40">
     <a target="_blank" href="http://airbnb.com">
      Airbnb
     </a>
     is that kind of idea.</span>  
<span class="s s41">In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we
thought it was too crazy.</span>  <span class="s s42">We couldn't believe large numbers of
people would want to stay in other people's places.</span>  <span class="s s43">We funded them
because we liked the founders so much.</span>  <span class="s s44">As soon as we heard they'd
been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded
breakfast cereal, they were in.</span>  <span class="s s45">And it turned out the idea was on
the right side of crazy after all.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s47">
     4. Naughtiness
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s48">Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they
tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.</span>  <span class="s s49">They're not Goody
Two-Shoes type good.</span>  <span class="s s50">Morally, they care about getting the big
questions right, but not about observing proprieties.</span>  <span class="s s51">That's why
I'd use the word naughty rather than evil.</span><span class="s s52">  They delight in
     <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/gba.html">
      breaking
rules
     </a>
     , but not rules that matter.</span>  <span class="s s53">This quality may be redundant
though; it may be implied by imagination.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s55">
     Sam Altman of
     <a target="_blank" href="http://loopt.com">
      Loopt
     </a>
     is one of the most successful alumni, so we
asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application
that would help us discover more people like him.</span>  <span class="s s56">He said to ask
about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage&acirc;&#128;&#148;hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into
computers.</span>  <span class="s s57">It has become one of the questions we pay most attention
to when judging applications.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s59">
     5. Friendship
    </span></h3>
    <p><span class="s s60">
     Empirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just
     <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">
      one
founder
     </a>
     .</span>  <span class="s s61">Most of the big successes have two or three.</span>  <span class="s s62">And the
relationship between the founders has to be strong.</span>  <span class="s s63">They must
genuinely like one another, and work well together.</span>  <span class="s s64">Startups do
to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:
if it can be pulled apart, it will be.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s66">
     Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of
     <a target="_blank" href="http://justin.tv">
      Justin.tv
     </a>
     are a good example of close
friends who work well together.</span>  <span class="s s67">They've known each other since
second grade.</span>  <span class="s s68">They can practically read one another's minds.</span>  <span class="s s69">I'm
sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed
any unresolved tension between them.</span>
