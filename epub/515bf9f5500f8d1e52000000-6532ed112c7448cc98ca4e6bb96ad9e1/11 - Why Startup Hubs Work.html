   <p>
    <span class="s s3">If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number
of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude.</span>
<span class="s s4">Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s6">I wondered about this for years.</span>  <span class="s s7">I could see the average town was
like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people
went in, but no startups came out.</span>  <span class="s s8">But I was never able to figure
out exactly what happened inside the motel&acirc;&#128;&#148;exactly what was
killing all the potential startups.</span><span class="s s9">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s10">A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out.</span> <span class="s s11">I was framing the
question wrong.</span>  <span class="s s12">The problem is not that most towns kill startups.</span><span class="s s13">
It's that death is the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/die.html">
     default
    </a>
    for startups,
and most towns don't save them.</span>  <span class="s s14">Instead of thinking of most places
as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of
startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with
the antidote.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s16">Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:
fail.</span><span class="s s17">  The real question is, what's
    <i>
     saving
    </i>
    startups in places
like Silicon Valley?</span><span class="s s18">

   <h3><span class="s s19">
    Environment
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">I think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place
where startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with
people who can help you.</span>  <span class="s s21">And what drives them both is the number
of startup people around you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s23">The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of
a startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in
starting a company to actually doing it.</span>  <span class="s s24">It's quite a leap to start
a startup.</span>  <span class="s s25">It's an unusual thing to do.</span> <span class="s s26">But in Silicon Valley it
seems normal.</span><span class="s s27">
                    
                     [
    <a name="f3" href="#f3n">

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if
you're unemployed.</span>  <span class="s s29">People in the Valley aren't automatically
impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they
pay attention.</span>  <span class="s s30">Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not
to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or
how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen
inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few
years later were billionaires.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s32">
    Having people around you care about what you're doing is an
extraordinarily
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/cities.html">
     powerful
    </a>
    force.</span>  <span class="s s33">Even the
most willful people are susceptible to it.</span>  <span class="s s34">About a year after we
started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known
VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering
starting another startup.</span>  <span class="s s35">He responded so eagerly that for about
half a second I found myself considering doing it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s37">In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't
seem real.</span>  <span class="s s38">In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.</span>  <span class="s s39">That
no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.</span>
<span class="s s40">But I think that's ok.</span>  <span class="s s41">Few people are suited to running a startup,
and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all
too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand),
so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the
optimal state of affairs.</span><span class="s s42">  As long as you're at a point in your
life when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find
out if you're suited to running a startup is to
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/notnot.html">
     try
it
    </a>
    .</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s44">
    Chance
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s45">The second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people
who can help you.</span>  <span class="s s46">This force works in both phases: both in the
transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and
the transition from starting a company to succeeding.</span>  <span class="s s47">The power
of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring
about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that
affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s49">Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters
that characteristically befall startups.</span>  <span class="s s50">In the Valley, terrible
things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups
everywhere.</span>  <span class="s s51">The reason startups are more likely to make it here
is that great things happen to them too.</span>  <span class="s s52">In the Valley, lightning
has a sign bit.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">For example, you start a site for college students and you decide
to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.</span>  <span class="s s55">And then on a
random suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean
Parker, who understands the domain really well because he started
a similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.</span><span class="s s56">  And
moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/control.html">
     control
    </a>
    of their companies.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s58">You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure
that one will happen.</span>  <span class="s s59">The best one can say is: if you're in a
startup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,
especially if you deserve them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s61">I bet this is true even for startups we fund.</span>  <span class="s s62">Even with us working
to make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,
the frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high
that it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s64">Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having
ideas.</span>  <span class="s s65">Most people have had the experience of working hard on some
problem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed,
and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.</span><span class="s s66">  What
makes the answer appear is letting your thoughts
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/top.html">
     drift
    </a>
    a bit&acirc;&#128;&#148;and thus drift off the wrong
path you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent
to it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s68">Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking
a shower lets your thoughts drift.</span> <span class="s s69">The critical thing in both cases
is that they drift just the right amount.</span>  <span class="s s70">The meeting between Larry
Page and Sergey Brin was a good example.</span>  <span class="s s71">They let their acquaintance
drift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had
a lot in common with.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s73">For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was
Sergey Brin, and vice versa.</span><span class="s s74">  The antidote is
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html">
     people
    </a>
    .</span>  <span class="s s75">It's not the
physical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, or
the weather, or anything like that.</span>  <span class="s s76">Those helped get it started,
but now that the reaction is self-sustaining what drives it is the
people.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">Many observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive things
about startup hubs is the degree to which people help one another
out, with no expectation of getting anything in return.</span>  <span class="s s79">I'm not
sure why this is so.</span>  <span class="s s80">Perhaps it's because startups are less of a
zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed
by competitors.</span>  <span class="s s81">Or perhaps it's because so many startup founders
have backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s83">A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.</span>  <span class="s s84">We're
a sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people
working on startups and their willingness to help one another are
both artificially amplified.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s86">
    Numbers
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s87">Both components of the antidote&acirc;&#128;&#148;an environment that encourages
startups, and chance meetings with people who help you&acirc;&#128;&#148;are
driven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people
around you.</span><span class="s s88">  To make a startup hub, you need a
    <i>
     lot
    </i>
    of people
interested in startups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s90">There are three reasons.</span> <span class="s s91">The first, obviously, is that if you don't
have enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.</span><span class="s s92">
                                                      
                                                       [
    <a name="f4" href="#f4n">
     4
    </a>
    ]
                                                      
                                                      The second is that different startups need such different things, so
you need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they need
most.</span>  <span class="s s93">Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.</span>  <span class="s s94">Another
startup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connections
in the movie business.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s96">This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies,
incidentally.</span>  <span class="s s97">The bigger the community, the greater the chance it
will contain the person who has that one thing you need most.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s99">The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is
that once you have enough people interested in the same problem,
they start to set the social norms.  And it is a particularly
valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do
something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.</span>  <span class="s s100">In most places
the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s102">I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.</span>  <span class="s s103">I notice this every time
I fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.</span>  
<span class="s s104">Obviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a
place looks.</span>  <span class="s s105">But there are different kinds of prosperity.</span>  <span class="s s106">Silicon
Valley doesn't look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.</span>  <span class="s s107">I tried
asking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valley
radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.</span>

I'm not saying it's impossible to succeed in a city with few
other startups, just harder.</span>  <span class="s s111">If you're sufficiently good at
generating your own morale, you can survive without external
encouragement.</span>  <span class="s s112">Wufoo was based in Tampa and they succeeded.</span>  <span class="s s113">But
the Wufoos are exceptionally disciplined.</span>

unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to

Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.</span>
<span class="s s119">I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but
essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.</span>  <span class="s s120">Most
new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those
don't scale.</span>

As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of
startup people in the Valley.</span>  <span class="s s123">Jessica and I bicycled to University
Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.</span>  <span class="s s124">As
we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.</span>  <span class="s s125">Selina
Tobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.</span>  <span class="s s126">Then Josh Wilson
came in to pick up a take out order.</span>  <span class="s s127">After lunch we went to get
frozen yogurt.</span>  <span class="s s128">On the way we met Rajat Suri.</span>  <span class="s s129">When we got to the
yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran
into Yuri Sagalov.</span>  <span class="s s130">We walked with him for a block or so and we ran
into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.</span>
<span class="s s131">This is everyday life in Palo Alto.</span>  <span class="s s132">I wasn't trying to meet people;
I was just having lunch.</span>  <span class="s s133">And I'm sure for every startup founder
or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't.</span>  <span class="s s134">If Ron
Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.</span>
