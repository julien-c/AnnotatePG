    <span class="s s2">Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming
languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it
fixes.</span>  <span class="s s3">The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be
described this way.</span>

how to describe this way.   Suggestions would be appreciated about any languages missing
from the list.What I'm looking for is not exactly what
motivated the language designer (Smalltalk was originally intended
for children) but what niche the language first lodged in.  What was
the appeal of the language to its first users?
