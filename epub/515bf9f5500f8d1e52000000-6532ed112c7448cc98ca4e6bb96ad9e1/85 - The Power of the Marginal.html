   <p>
    <span class="s s4">A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Apple
garage.</span>  <span class="s s5">As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up in
Saskatchewan he'd been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak
must have had to work in a garage.</span>  <span class="s s6">"Those guys must have been
freezing!</span><span class="s s7">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild climate means
there's lots of marginal space.</span>  <span class="s s10">In cold places that margin gets
trimmed off.</span>  <span class="s s11">There's a sharper line between outside and inside,
and only projects that are officially sanctioned&mdash;by organizations,
or parents, or wives, or at least by oneself&mdash;get proper indoor
space.</span>  <span class="s s12">That raises the activation energy for new ideas.</span>  <span class="s s13">You can't
just tinker.</span> <span class="s s14">You have to justify.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s16">Some of Silicon Valley's most famous companies began in garages:
Hewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998.</span>  <span class="s s17">In Apple's
case the garage story is a bit of an urban legend.</span>  <span class="s s18">Woz says all
they did there was assemble some computers, and that he did all the
actual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or his
cube at HP.</span><span class="s s19">
              
               [

    ]
              
              This was apparently too marginal even for Apple's PR
people.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people
too.</span>  <span class="s s22">Obviously they were smart, but they can't have looked good
on paper.</span>  <span class="s s23">They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with
about three years of school between them, and hippies to boot.</span>
<span class="s s24">Their previous business experience consisted of making "blue boxes"
to hack into the phone system, a business with the rare distinction
of being both illegal and unprofitable.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s26">
    Outsiders
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s27">Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would
feel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, or
the painter who can't afford to heat his studio and thus has to
wear a beret indoors.</span>  <span class="s s28">But in 1976 it didn't seem so cool.</span>  <span class="s s29">The
world hadn't yet realized that starting a computer company was in
the same category as being a writer or a painter.</span> <span class="s s30">It hadn't been
for long.</span>  <span class="s s31">Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall
in the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">In 1976, everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage,
including the founders.</span>  <span class="s s34">One of the first things Jobs did when they
got some money was to rent office space.</span>  <span class="s s35">He wanted Apple to seem
like a real company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s37">They already had something few real companies ever have: a fabulously well
designed product.</span>  <span class="s s38">You'd think they'd have had more confidence.</span>
<span class="s s39">But I've talked to a lot of startup founders, and it's always this
way.</span>  <span class="s s40">They've built something that's going to change the world, and
they're worried about some nit like not having proper business
cards.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s42">That's the paradox I want to explore: great new things often come
from the margins, and yet the people who discover them are looked
down on by everyone, including themselves.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s44">It's an old idea that new things come from the margins.</span> <span class="s s45">I want to
examine its internal structure.</span>  <span class="s s46">Why do great ideas come from the
margins?</span>  <span class="s s47">What kind of ideas?</span>  <span class="s s48">And is there anything we can do to
encourage the process?</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s50">
    Insiders
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s51">One reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply that
there's so much of it.</span> <span class="s s52">There have to be more outsiders than insiders,
if insider means anything.</span>  <span class="s s53">If the number of outsiders is huge it
will always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them, even if few
do per capita.</span>  <span class="s s54">But I think there's more going on than this.</span>  <span class="s s55">There
are real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds of
work they can outweigh the advantages.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s57">Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided
to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel.</span>
<span class="s s58">First there'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose.</span>
<span class="s s59">Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one
side or the other.</span>  <span class="s s60">Of the remainder, the smart ones would refuse
such a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition.</span>
<span class="s s61">The committee would choose one at the height of his career&mdash;that
is, someone whose best work was behind him&mdash;and hand over the
project with copious free advice about how the book should show in
positive terms the strength and diversity of the American people,
etc, etc.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s63">The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge
weight of expectation on his shoulders.</span>  <span class="s s64">Not wanting to blow such
a public commission, he'd play it safe.</span>  <span class="s s65">This book had better command
respect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy.</span>
<span class="s s66">Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people they
feel obliged to take you seriously.</span>  <span class="s s67">As everyone knows, America
plus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that's what it would have to
be about.</span>  <span class="s s68">Better stick to the standard cartoon version that the
Civil War was about slavery; people would be confused otherwise;
plus you can show a lot of strength and diversity.</span><span class="s s69">  When finally
completed twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pastiche
of existing popular novels&mdash;roughly
    <i>
     Gone with the Wind
    </i>
    plus
    <i>
     Roots
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s70">But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller
for a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host's
autobiography.</span>  <span class="s s71">The book would be made into a movie and thereupon
forgotten, except by the more waspish sort of reviewers, among whom
it would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli or Battlefield
Earth.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s73">Maybe I got a little carried away with this example.</span>  <span class="s s74">And yet is
this not at each point the way such a project would play out?</span>  <span class="s s75">The
government knows better than to get into the novel business, but
in other fields where they have a natural monopoly, like nuclear
waste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime change, you'd find plenty
of projects isomorphic to this one&mdash;and indeed, plenty that were
less successful.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s77">This little thought experiment suggests a few of the disadvantages
of insider projects: the selection of the wrong kind of people, the
excessive scope, the inability to take risks, the need to seem
serious, the weight of expectations, the power of vested interests,
the undiscerning audience, and perhaps most dangerous, the tendency
of such work to become a duty rather than a pleasure.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s79">
    Tests
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s80">A world with outsiders and insiders implies some kind of test for
distinguishing between them.</span>  <span class="s s81">And the trouble with most tests for
selecting elites is that there are two ways to pass them: to be
good at what they try to measure, and to be good at hacking the
test itself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s83">So the first question to ask about a field is how honest its tests
are, because this tells you what it means to be an outsider.</span>  <span class="s s84">This
tells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree with
authorities, whether it's worth going through the usual channels
to become one yourself, and perhaps whether you want to work in
this field at all.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s86">Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards for
quality, and the people running the test really care about its
integrity.</span>  <span class="s s87">Admissions to PhD programs in the hard sciences are
fairly honest, for example.</span>  <span class="s s88">The professors will get whoever they
admit as their own grad students, so they try hard to choose well,
and they have a fair amount of data to go on.</span>  <span class="s s89">Whereas undergraduate
admissions seem to be much more hackable.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s91">One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the
overlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teach
the subject in universities.</span>  <span class="s s92">At one end of the scale you have
fields like math and physics, where nearly all the teachers are
among the best practitioners.</span>  <span class="s s93">In the middle are medicine, law,
history, architecture, and computer science, where many are.</span>  <span class="s s94">At
the bottom are business, literature, and the visual arts, where
there's almost no overlap between the teachers and the leading
practitioners.</span>  <span class="s s95">It's this end that gives rise to phrases like "those
who can't do, teach.</span><span class="s s96">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s98">Incidentally, this scale might be helpful in deciding what to study
in college.</span>  <span class="s s99">When I was in college the rule seemed to be that you
should study whatever you were most interested in.</span>  <span class="s s100">But in retrospect
you're probably better off studying something moderately interesting
with someone who's good at it than something very interesting with
someone who isn't.</span>  <span class="s s101">You often hear people say that you shouldn't
major in business in college, but this is actually an instance of
a more general rule: don't learn things from teachers who are bad
at them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s103">How much you should worry about being an outsider depends on the
quality of the insiders.</span>  <span class="s s104">If you're an amateur mathematician and
think you've solved a famous open problem, better go back and check.</span>
<span class="s s105">When I was in grad school, a friend in the math department had the
job of replying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat's last theorem
and so on, and it did not seem as if he saw it as a valuable source
of tips&mdash;more like manning a mental health hotline.</span>  <span class="s s106">Whereas if
the stuff you're writing seems different from what English professors
are interested in, that's not necessarily a problem.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s108">
    Anti-Tests
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s109">Where the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, most
of the good people will be outsiders.</span><span class="s s110">  In art, for example, the
image of the poor, misunderstood genius is not just one possible
image of a great artist: it's the
    <i>
     standard
    </i>
    image.</span>  <span class="s s111">I'm not
saying it's correct, incidentally, but it is telling how well this
image has stuck.</span>  <span class="s s112">You couldn't make a rap like that stick to math
or medicine.</span><span class="s s113">
                                                          
                                                           [

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s114">If it's corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering out
the people it should select by making them to do things only the
wrong people would do.</span><span class="s s115">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html">
     Popularity
    </a>
    in high school
seems to be such a test.</span>  <span class="s s116">There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup
world.</span>  <span class="s s117">For example, rising up through the hierarchy of the average
big company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful people
could spare.</span><span class="s s118">
                                                            
                                                             [

                                                            Someone like Bill Gates can grow a company under
him, but it's hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the
corporate ladder at General Electric&mdash;or Microsoft, actually.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s120">It's kind of strange when you think about it, because lord-of-the-flies
schools and bureaucratic companies are both the default.</span>  <span class="s s121">There are
probably a lot of people who go from one to the other and never
realize the whole world doesn't work this way.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s123">I think that's one reason big companies are so often blindsided by
startups.</span>  
<span class="s s124">People at big companies don't realize the extent to which
they live in an environment that is one large, ongoing test for the
wrong qualities.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s126">If you're an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders are
obviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite.</span>  <span class="s s127">But
there's a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won't be
recognized, at least in your lifetime.</span>  <span class="s s128">You may feel you don't need
that, but history suggests it's dangerous to work in fields with
corrupt tests.</span>  <span class="s s129">You may beat the insiders, and yet not do as good
work, on an absolute scale, as you would in a field that was more
honest.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s131">Standards in art, for example, were almost as corrupt in the first
half of the eighteenth century as they are today.</span>  <span class="s s132">This was the era
of those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their lapdogs.</span><span class="s s133">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/largilliere-chardin.html">
     Chardin
    </a>
    decided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he
saw them.</span>  <span class="s s134">He's now considered the best of that period&mdash;and yet
not the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling, who all had the
additional encouragement of honest standards.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s136">It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, if
it's followed by another that isn't corrupt.</span>  <span class="s s137">For example, it would
be worth competing with a company that can spend more than you on
marketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, when
customers compare your actual products.</span>  <span class="s s138">Similarly, you shouldn't
be discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of college admissions,
because it's followed immediately by less hackable tests.</span><span class="s s139">
                                                                      
                                                                       [

   <h3><span class="s s140">
    Risk
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s141">Even in a field with honest tests, there are still advantages to
being an outsider.</span>  <span class="s s142">The most obvious is that outsiders have nothing
to lose.</span>  <span class="s s143">They can do risky things, and if they fail, so what?</span>  <span class="s s144">Few
will even notice.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s146">The eminent, on the other hand, are weighed down by their eminence.</span>
<span class="s s147">Eminence is like a suit: it impresses the wrong people, and it
constrains the wearer.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s149">Outsiders should realize the advantage they have here.</span>  <span class="s s150">Being able
to take risks is hugely valuable.</span>  <span class="s s151">Everyone values safety too much,
both the obscure and the eminent.</span>  <span class="s s152">No one wants to look like a fool.</span>
<span class="s s153">But it's very useful to be able to.</span>  <span class="s s154">If most of your ideas aren't
stupid, you're probably being too conservative.</span>  <span class="s s155">You're not bracketing
the problem.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s157">Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character
at its worst.</span>  <span class="s s158">For example, if you write one great book and ten bad
ones, you still count as a great writer&mdash;or at least, a better
writer than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good.</span>  <span class="s s159">Whereas
if you're a quiet, law-abiding citizen most of the time but
occasionally cut someone up and bury them in your backyard, you're
a bad guy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s161">Almost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they were
indications of character rather than talent&mdash;as if having a stupid
idea made you stupid.</span>   <span class="s s162">There's a huge weight of tradition advising
us to play it safe.</span>  <span class="s s163">"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps
silent," says the Old Testament (Proverbs 17:28).</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s165">Well, that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in Bronze
Age Palestine.</span>  <span class="s s166">There conservatism would be the order of the day.</span>
<span class="s s167">But times have changed.</span>  <span class="s s168">It might still be reasonable to stick with
the Old Testament in political questions, but materially the world
now has a lot more state.</span>  <span class="s s169">Tradition is less of a guide, not just
because things change faster, but because the space of possibilities
is so large.</span>   <span class="s s170">The more complicated the world gets, the more valuable
it is to be willing to look like a fool.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s172">
    Delegation
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s173">And yet the more successful people become, the more heat they get
if they screw up&mdash;or even seem to screw up.</span>  <span class="s s174">In this respect, as
in many others, the eminent are prisoners of their own success.</span>  <span class="s s175">So
the best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider may
be to look at the disadvantages of being an insider.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s177">If you ask eminent people what's wrong with their lives, the first
thing they'll complain about is the lack of time.</span>  <span class="s s178">A friend of mine
at Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work for
them long before they went public.</span>  <span class="s s179">In other words, he's now rich
enough not to have to work.</span>  <span class="s s180">I asked him if he could still endure
the annoyances of having a job, now that he didn't have to.</span><span class="s s181">  And
he said that there weren't really any annoyances, except&mdash;and he
got a wistful look when he said this&mdash;that he got
    <i>
     so much
email
    </i>
    .</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s183">The eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them.</span>
<span class="s s184">The problem is so widespread that people pretending to be eminent
do it by pretending to be overstretched.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s186">The lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that's not good for
thinking.</span>  <span class="s s187">One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long,
uninterrupted blocks of time.</span>  <span class="s s188">That's what I remember about grad
school: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worrying
about, but not writing, my dissertation.</span>  <span class="s s189">Obscurity is like health
food&mdash;unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you.</span>  <span class="s s190">Whereas fame tends
to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation.</span> <span class="s s191">When it reaches
a certain concentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s193">The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning
into managers.</span>  <span class="s s194">They don't have time to work.</span>  <span class="s s195">They're surrounded
by junior people they're supposed to help or supervise.</span>  <span class="s s196">The obvious
solution is to have the junior people do the work.</span>  <span class="s s197">Some good
stuff happens this way, but there are problems it doesn't work so
well for: the kind where it helps to have everything in one head.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s199">For example, it recently emerged that the famous glass artist Dale
Chihuly hasn't actually blown glass for 27 years.</span>  <span class="s s200">He has assistants
do the work for him.</span>  <span class="s s201">But one of the most valuable sources of ideas
in the visual arts is the resistance of the medium.</span>  <span class="s s202">That's why oil
paintings look so different from watercolors.</span>  <span class="s s203">In principle you
could make any mark in any medium; in practice the medium steers
you.</span>  <span class="s s204">And if you're no longer doing the work yourself, you stop
learning from this.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s206">So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one way
to do it is to take advantage of direct contact with the medium.</span>
<span class="s s207">In the arts it's obvious how: blow your own glass, edit your own
films, stage your own plays.</span>  <span class="s s208">And in the process pay close attention
to accidents and to new ideas you have on the fly.</span>  <span class="s s209">This technique
can be generalized to any sort of work: if you're an outsider, don't
be ruled by plans.</span>  <span class="s s210">Planning is often just a weakness forced on
those who delegate.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s212">Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one
head?</span>  <span class="s s213">Well, you can manufacture them by taking any project usually
done by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself.</span>  <span class="s s214">Wozniak's
work was a classic example: he did everything himself, hardware and
software, and the result was miraculous.</span>  <span class="s s215">He claims not one bug was
ever found in the Apple II, in either hardware or software.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s217">Another way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focus
on the grooves in the chocolate bar&mdash;the places where tasks are
divided when they're split between several people.</span>  <span class="s s218">If you want to
beat delegation, focus on a vertical slice: for example, be both
writer and editor, or both design buildings and construct them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s220">One especially good groove to span is the one between tools and
things made with them.</span><span class="s s221">  For example, programming languages and
applications are usually written by different people, and this is
responsible for a lot of the worst flaws in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/hundred.html">
     programming languages
    </a>
    .</span>
<span class="s s222">I think every language should be designed simultaneously with a
large application written in it, the way C was with Unix.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s224">Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business,
because delegation is endemic there.</span>  <span class="s s225">Instead of avoiding it as a
drawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity.</span>
<span class="s s226">In big companies software is often designed, implemented, and sold
by three separate types of people.</span>  <span class="s s227">In startups one person may have
to do all three.</span>  <span class="s s228">And though this feels stressful, it's one reason
startups win.</span>  <span class="s s229">The needs of customers and the means of satisfying
them are all in one head.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s231">
    Focus
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s232">The very skill of insiders can be a weakness.</span>  <span class="s s233">Once someone is good
at something, they tend to spend all their time doing that.</span>  <span class="s s234">This
kind of focus is very valuable, actually.</span>  <span class="s s235">Much of the skill of
experts is the ability to ignore false trails.</span>  <span class="s s236">But focus has
drawbacks: you don't learn from other fields, and when a new approach
arrives, you may be the last to notice.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s238">For outsiders this translates into two ways to win.</span>  <span class="s s239">One is to work
on a variety of things.</span>  <span class="s s240">Since you can't derive as much benefit
(yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net and
derive what benefit you can from similarities between fields.</span>  <span class="s s241">Just
as you can compete with delegation by working on larger vertical
slices, you can compete with specialization by working on larger
horizontal slices&mdash;by both writing and illustrating your book, for
example.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s243">The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks.</span>
<span class="s s244">In particular, new things.</span>  <span class="s s245">So if you're not good at anything yet,
consider working on something so new that no one else is either.</span>
<span class="s s246">It won't have any prestige yet, if no one is good at it, but you'll
have it all to yourself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s248">The potential of a new medium is usually underestimated, precisely
because no one has yet explored its possibilities.</span><span class="s s249">  Before
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/pilate.html">
     Durer
    </a>
    tried making engravings, no one took them very seriously.</span>  <span class="s s250">Engraving
was for making little devotional images&mdash;basically fifteenth century
baseball cards of saints.</span><span class="s s251">  Trying to make masterpieces in this
medium must have seemed to Durer's contemporaries that way that,
say, making masterpieces in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/clowes.html">
     comics
    </a>
    might seem to the average person
today.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s253">In the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: the
minicomputer, the microprocessor, the web-based application.</span>  <span class="s s254">At
first they're always dismissed as being unsuitable for real work.</span>
<span class="s s255">And yet someone always decides to try anyway, and it turns out you
can do more than anyone expected.</span>  <span class="s s256">So in the future when you hear
people say of a new platform: yeah, it's popular and cheap, but not
ready yet for real work, jump on it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s258">As well as being more comfortable working on established lines,
insiders generally have a vested interest in perpetuating them.</span>
<span class="s s259">The professor who made his reputation by discovering some new idea
is not likely to be the one to discover its replacement.</span>  <span class="s s260">This is
particularly true with companies, who have not only skill and pride
anchoring them to the status quo, but money as well.</span> <span class="s s261">The Achilles
heel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize
themselves.</span>  <span class="s s262">Many innovations consist of replacing something with
a cheaper alternative, and companies just don't want to see a path
whose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s264">So if you're an outsider you should actively seek out contrarian
projects.</span>  <span class="s s265">Instead of working on things the eminent have made
prestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s267">The really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders reject
as impossible, but those they ignore as undignified.</span>  <span class="s s268">For example,
after Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to his
employer, HP.</span>  <span class="s s269">They passed.</span>  <span class="s s270">One of the reasons was that, to save
money, he'd designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP
felt they couldn't produce anything so declasse.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s272">
    Less
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s273">Wozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn't
afford a monitor.</span>  <span class="s s274">Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to
make things that are cheap and lightweight.</span>  <span class="s s275">And both are good bets
for growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things
evolve faster.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s277">The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large
scale.</span>  <span class="s s278">Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums.
One reason they work on big things is that they can: like our
hypothetical novelist, they're flattered by such opportunities.</span>
<span class="s s279">They also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impress
the audience.</span>  <span class="s s280">A garden shed, however lovely, would be easy to
ignore; a few might even snicker at it.</span>  <span class="s s281">You can't snicker at a
giant museum, no matter how much you dislike it.</span>  <span class="s s282">And finally, there
are all those people the eminent have working for them; they have
to choose projects that can keep them all busy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s284">Outsiders are free of all this.</span>  <span class="s s285">They can work on small things, and
there's something very pleasing about small things.</span>  <span class="s s286">Small things
can be perfect; big ones always have something wrong with them.</span><span class="s s287">
But there's a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/isetta.html">
     magic
    </a>
    in small things that goes beyond such rational
explanations.</span>  <span class="s s288">All kids know it.</span>  <span class="s s289">Small things have more personality.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s291">Plus making them is more fun.</span>  <span class="s s292">You can do what you want; you don't
have to satisfy committees.</span>  <span class="s s293">And perhaps most important, small
things can be done fast.</span>  <span class="s s294">The prospect of seeing the finished project
hangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking.</span>  <span class="s s295">If you work
fast, maybe you could have it done tonight.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s297">Working on small things is also a good way to learn.</span>  <span class="s s298">The most
important kinds of learning happen one project at a time.</span>  <span class="s s299">("Next
time, I won't.</span><span class="s s300">.</span><span class="s s301">.</span><span class="s s302">"</span><span class="s s303">)  The faster you cycle through projects, the
faster you'll evolve.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s305">Plain materials have a charm like small scale.</span>  <span class="s s306">And in addition
there's the challenge of making do with less.</span>  <span class="s s307">Every designer's
ears perk up at the mention of that game, because it's a game you
can't lose.</span>  <span class="s s308">Like the JV playing the varsity, if you even tie, you
win.</span>  <span class="s s309">So paradoxically there are cases where fewer resources yield
better results, because the designers' pleasure at their own ingenuity
more than compensates.</span><span class="s s310">
                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                             [

   <p>
    <span class="s s311">So if you're an outsider, take advantage of your ability to make
small and inexpensive things.</span>  <span class="s s312">Cultivate the pleasure and simplicity
of that kind of work; one day you'll miss it.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s314">
    Responsibility
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s315">When you're old and eminent, what will you miss about being young
and obscure?</span>  <span class="s s316">What people seem to miss most is the lack of
responsibilities.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s318">Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence.</span>  <span class="s s319">In principle
you could avoid it, just as in principle you could avoid getting
fat as you get old, but few do.</span>  <span class="s s320">I sometimes suspect that responsibility
is a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it,
but regardless it's certainly constraining.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s322">When you're an outsider you're constrained too, of course.</span>  <span class="s s323">You're
short of money, for example.</span>  <span class="s s324">But that constrains you in different
ways.</span>  <span class="s s325">How does responsibility constrain you?</span>  <span class="s s326">The worst thing is
that it allows you not to focus on real work.</span><span class="s s327">  Just as the most
dangerous forms of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">
     procrastination
    </a>
    are those that seem like work,
the danger of responsibilities is not just that they can consume a
whole day, but that they can do it without setting off the
kind of alarms you'd set off if you spent a whole day sitting on a
park bench.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s329">A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one's own
procrastination.</span>  <span class="s s330">But this is actually a good thing.</span>  <span class="s s331">You're at
least close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s333">As an outsider, you're just one step away from getting things done.</span>
<span class="s s334">A huge step, admittedly, and one that most people never seem to
make, but only one step.</span>  <span class="s s335">If you can summon up the energy to get
started, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses)
that few insiders can match.</span>  <span class="s s336">For insiders work turns into a duty,
laden with responsibilities and expectations.</span>  <span class="s s337">It's never so pure
as it was when they were young.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s339">
    Work like a dog being taken for a walk, instead of an ox being yoked
to the plow.  That's what they miss.
   </span></p>
   <h3><span class="s s340">
    Audience
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s341">A lot of outsiders make the mistake of doing the opposite; they
admire the eminent so much that they copy even their flaws.</span>  <span class="s s342">Copying
is a good way to learn, but copy the right things.</span>  <span class="s s343">When I was in
college I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors.</span><span class="s s344">  But
this wasn't what
    <i>
     made
    </i>
    them eminent&mdash;it was more a flaw their
eminence had allowed them to sink into.</span>   <span class="s s345">Imitating it was like
pretending to have gout in order to seem rich.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s347">Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actually
disadvantages.</span>  <span class="s s348">Imitating these is not only a waste of time, but
will make you seem a fool to your models, who are often well aware
of it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s350">What are the genuine advantages of being an insider?</span>  <span class="s s351">The greatest
is an audience.</span>  <span class="s s352">It often seems to outsiders that the great advantage
of insiders is money&mdash;that they have the resources to do what they
want.</span>  <span class="s s353">But so do people who inherit money, and that doesn't seem
to help, not as much as an audience.</span>  <span class="s s354">It's good for morale to know
people want to see what you're making; it draws work out of you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s356">If I'm right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience,
then we live in exciting times, because just in the last ten years
the Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid.</span>  <span class="s s357">Outsiders don't
have to content themselves anymore with a proxy audience of a few
smart friends.</span>  <span class="s s358">Now, thanks to the Internet, they can start to grow
themselves actual audiences.</span>  <span class="s s359">This is great news for the marginal,
who retain the advantages of outsiders while increasingly being
able to siphon off what had till recently been the prerogative of
the elite.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s361">Though the Web has been around for more than ten years, I think
we're just beginning to see its democratizing effects.</span>  <span class="s s362">Outsiders
are still learning how to steal audiences.</span><span class="s s363">  But more importantly,
audiences are still learning how to be stolen&mdash;they're still just
beginning to realize how much
    <a target="_blank" href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2004/03/15/lott_case.html">
     deeper

    <span class="s s364">The big media companies shouldn't worry that people will post their
copyrighted material on YouTube.</span>  <span class="s s365">They should worry that people
will post their own stuff on YouTube, and audiences will watch that
instead.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s367">
    Hacking
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s368">If I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentence
it would be: just try hacking something together.</span>  <span class="s s369">That phrase draws
in most threads I've mentioned here.</span>   <span class="s s370">Hacking something together
means deciding what to do as you're doing it, not a subordinate
executing the vision of his boss.</span>  <span class="s s371">It implies the result won't
be pretty, because it will be made quickly out of inadequate
materials.</span>  <span class="s s372">It may work, but it won't be the sort of thing the
eminent would want to put their name on.</span>  <span class="s s373">Something hacked together
means something that barely solves the problem, or maybe doesn't
solve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route.</span>  <span class="s s374">But
that's ok, because the main value of that initial version is not the
thing itself, but what it leads to.</span>  <span class="s s375">Insiders who daren't walk
through the mud in their nice clothes will never make it to the
solid ground on the other side.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s377">The word "try" is an especially valuable component.</span>  <span class="s s378">I disagree
here with Yoda, who said there is no try.</span>  <span class="s s379">There is try.</span>  <span class="s s380">It implies
there's no punishment if you fail.</span>  <span class="s s381">You're driven by curiosity
instead of duty.</span>  <span class="s s382">That means the wind of procrastination will be
in your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what you
do as a way of avoiding other work.</span>  <span class="s s383">And when you do it, you'll be
in a better mood.</span>  <span class="s s384">The more the work depends on imagination, the
more that matters, because most people have more ideas when they're
happy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s386">If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing
I'd do more of: just try hacking things together.</span>  <span class="s s387">Like many people
that age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do.</span>
<span class="s s388">I also spent some time trying to build stuff.</span>  <span class="s s389">I should have spent
less time worrying and more time building.</span>  <span class="s s390">If you're not sure what
to do, make something.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s392">Raymond Chandler's advice to thriller writers was "When in doubt,
have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.</span><span class="s s393">"</span>  <span class="s s394">He followed
that advice.</span>  <span class="s s395">Judging from his books, he was often in doubt.</span>  <span class="s s396">But
though the result is occasionally cheesy, it's never boring.</span>  <span class="s s397">In
life, as in books, action is underrated.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s399">Fortunately the number of things you can just hack together keeps
increasing.</span>   <span class="s s400">People fifty years ago would be astonished that one
could just hack together a movie, for example.</span>  <span class="s s401">Now you can even
hack together distribution.</span>  <span class="s s402">Just make stuff and put it online.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s404">
    Inappropriate
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s405">If you really want to score big, the place to focus is the margin
of the margin: the territories only recently captured from the
insiders.</span>  <span class="s s406">That's where you'll find the juiciest projects still
undone, either because they seemed too risky, or simply because
there were too few insiders to explore everything.</span>

needs the resistance of the plate.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s413">Up till a few years ago, writing essays was the ultimate insider's
game.</span>  <span class="s s414">Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about their
field, but the pool allowed to write on general topics was about
eight people who went to the right parties in New York.</span>  <span class="s s415">Now the
reconquista has overrun this territory, and, not surprisingly, found
it sparsely cultivated.</span>  <span class="s s416">There are so many essays yet unwritten.</span>

exhausted the motherhood and apple pie topics.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s419">This leads to my final suggestion: a technique for determining when
you're on the right track.</span>  <span class="s s420">You're on the right track when people
complain that you're unqualified, or that you've done something

something rather than sitting around, which is the first step.</span>  <span class="s s422">And

you've probably done something good.</span>

    If you make something and people complain that it doesn't

that's a problem.</span>  <span class="s s425">But if the worst thing they can hit you with is
your own status as an outsider, that implies that in every other
respect you've succeeded.</span>  <span class="s s426">Pointing out that someone is unqualified

As usual the popular image is several decades behind reality.</span>
<span class="s s444">Now the misunderstood artist is not a chain-smoking drunk who pours
his soul into big, messy canvases that philistines see and say
"that's not art" because it isn't a picture of anything.</span>  <span class="s s445">The
philistines have now been trained that anything hung on a wall
is art.</span>  <span class="s s446">Now the misunderstood artist is a coffee-drinking vegan
cartoonist whose work they see and say "that's not art" because it
looks like stuff they've seen in the Sunday paper.</span>

In fact this would do fairly well as a definition of politics:
what determines rank in the absence of objective tests.</span>

In high school you're led to believe your whole future depends
on where you go to college, but it turns out only to buy you a couple
years.</span> <span class="s s451">By your mid-twenties the people worth impressing
already judge you more by what
you've done than where you went to school.</span>

Managers are presumably wondering, how can I make this miracle
happen?</span>  <span class="s s454">How can I make the people working for me do more with less?</span>

Without the prospect of publication, the closest most people
come to writing essays is to write in a journal.</span>  <span class="s s459">I find I never
get as deeply into subjects as I do in proper essays.</span>  <span class="s s460">As the name
implies, you don't go back and rewrite journal entries over
and over for two weeks.</span>
