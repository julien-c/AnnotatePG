   Why YC
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   March 2006, rev August 2009
  </span></h2>
  <p><span class="s s3">
   Yesterday one of the founders we funded asked me why we started
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">
    Y
Combinator
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s4">Or more precisely, he asked if we'd started YC mainly
for fun.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s6">Kind of, but not quite.</span>  <span class="s s7">It is enormously fun to be able to work
with Rtm and Trevor again.</span>  <span class="s s8">I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and
for all the years after I always had a background process running,
looking for something we could do together.</span>  <span class="s s9">There is definitely
an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator.</span>  <span class="s s10">Every couple days I
slip and call it "Viaweb.</span><span class="s s11">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money.</span>  <span class="s s14">I was sick of
living from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just
work as hard as I could till I'd made enough to solve the problem
once and for all.</span>  <span class="s s15">Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn't designed
for fun, and mostly it wasn't.</span>  <span class="s s16">I'd be surprised if any startup is.</span>
<span class="s s17">All startups are mostly schleps.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s19">The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor
virtuous.</span>  <span class="s s20">We didn't start it mainly to make money; we have no idea
what our average returns might be, and won't know for years.</span>  <span class="s s21">Nor
did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though
we do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the
thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been
doing something unselfish.</span>  <span class="s s22">(It's oddly nondeterministic.</span><span class="s s23">)</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s24">
   The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/gba.html">
    hacker
   </a>
   would understand.</span>  <span class="s s25">We did it because it seems such a great
hack.</span>  <span class="s s26">There are thousands of smart people who could start companies
and don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at
just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new
startups that might otherwise not have existed.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good
thing.</span>  <span class="s s29">But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire
that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device
and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more
efficiently.</span>  <span class="s s30">In this case, the device is the world's economy, which
fortunately happens to be open source.</span>
