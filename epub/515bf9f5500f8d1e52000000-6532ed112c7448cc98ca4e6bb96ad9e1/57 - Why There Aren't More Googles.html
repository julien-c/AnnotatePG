    recently that the reason there aren't more Googles is
that most startups get bought before they can change the world.</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s5">Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo&mdash;what
  must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time&mdash;didn't
  sell out.</span> <span class="s s6">Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or
  MSN's search box.</span>
    </blockquote>
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">Why isn't it?</span> <span class="s s9">Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:
  a conviction to change the world for the better.</span>
    <span class="s s10">This has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true.</span> 
<span class="s s11">Google's founders were willing to sell early on.</span>
<span class="s s12">They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s14">
    It was the same with Facebook.  They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it 
by offering too little.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising
your offer, because there's a good chance the outrageous price they 
want will later seem a bargain.</span><span class="s s16">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s17">From the evidence I've seen so far,
startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better.</span>  
<span class="s s18">Not always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or
perhaps even an IPO.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down
acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue
startups.</span>  <span class="s s21">More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who
have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very
successful.</span>  <span class="s s22">That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s24">While I'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at
least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent
company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:
acquirers underestimated them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s26">Corporate M&A; is a strange business in that respect.</span>  <span class="s s27">They consistently
lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the
most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make
it big.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s29">
    VCs
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">So what's the real reason there aren't more Googles?</span>  <span class="s s31">Curiously
enough, it's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained
independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">The reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage
innovative startups to sell out, but that they won't even fund them.</span>
<span class="s s34">I've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y
Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them.</span>
<span class="s s35">The most surprising thing I've learned is how conservative they
are.</span>  <span class="s s36">VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation.</span>
<span class="s s37">Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in
reality than you'd guess from reading their sites.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s39">I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous.</span>  <span class="s s40">On
closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats.</span>
<span class="s s41">They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at
least), but less bold.</span>  <span class="s s42">Maybe the VC industry has changed.</span>  <span class="s s43">Maybe
they used to be bolder.</span>  
<span class="s s44">But I suspect it's the startup world that has
changed, not them.</span>  <span class="s s45">The low cost of starting a startup means the
average good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still
operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s47">Howard Aiken said "Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.</span>
<span class="s s48">If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's
throats.</span><span class="s s49">"</span> <span class="s s50">I have a similar feeling when I'm trying to convince VCs
to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded.</span>  <span class="s s51">They're terrified
of really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen
to compensate.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s53">But it's the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns.</span>  <span class="s s54">Any
really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone
would already be doing it.</span>  <span class="s s55">And
yet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms,
but within the VC community.</span>  <span class="s s56">The biggest factor determining how a
VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it.</span>  <span class="s s57">I
doubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they'll miss
all the very best ideas.</span>  <span class="s s58">The more people who have to like a new
idea, the more outliers you lose.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s60">
    Whoever the next Google is, they're probably being told right now
by VCs to come back when they have more "traction."
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s61">Why are VCs so conservative?</span>  <span class="s s62">It's probably a combination of factors.</span>
<span class="s s63">The large size of their investments makes them conservative.</span>
<span class="s s64">Plus they're investing other people's money, which makes
them worry they'll get in trouble if they do something risky and
it fails.</span>  <span class="s s65">Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical
guys, so they don't understand what the startups they're investing
in do.</span>

   <p>
    <span class="s s68">The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals
opportunity.</span>  <span class="s s69">And so it is in this case.</span>  <span class="s s70">There is a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup investing.</span>  <span class="s s71">Y Combinator funds startups at
the very beginning.</span>  <span class="s s72">VCs will fund them once they're already starting
to succeed.</span>  <span class="s s73">But between the two there is a substantial gap.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing
more than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2
million to a startup that's already taking off,
but there aren't enough investors who will give $200k to a startup
that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out.</span>
<span class="s s76">This territory is occupied mostly by
individual angel investors&mdash;people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who
gave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some
things to figure out.</span> <span class="s s77">I like angels, but there just aren't enough
of them, and investing is for most of them a part time job.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s79">And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied
territory is becoming more and more valuable.</span>   <span class="s s80">Nowadays a lot of
startups don't want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds.</span>
<span class="s s81">They don't need that much money, and they don't want the hassles
that come with it.</span>  <span class="s s82">The median startup coming out of Y Combinator
wants to raise $250-500k.</span>  <span class="s s83">When they go to VC firms they have to
ask for more because they know VCs aren't interested in such small
deals.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s85">VCs are money managers.</span>  <span class="s s86">They're looking for ways to put large sums
to work.</span>  <span class="s s87">But the startup world is evolving away from their current
model.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s89">Startups have gotten cheaper.</span>  <span class="s s90">That means they want less money, but
also that there are more of them.</span>  <span class="s s91">So you can still get large returns
on large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s93">I've tried to explain this to VC firms.  Instead of making one $2
million investment, make five $400k investments.</span>  <span class="s s94">Would that mean
sitting on too many boards?</span>  <span class="s s95">Don't sit on their boards.</span>  <span class="s s96">Would that
mean too much due diligence?</span>  <span class="s s97">Do less.</span>  <span class="s s98">If you're investing at a
tenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s100">It seems obvious.</span>  <span class="s s101">But I've proposed to several VC firms that they
set aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smaller
bets, and they react as if I'd proposed the partners all get nose
rings.</span>  <span class="s s102">It's remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.</span><span class="s s103">o.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">But there is a big opportunity here, and one way or the other it's
going to get filled.</span>  <span class="s s106">Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or,
more likely, new investors will appear to fill it.</span>  <span class="s s107">That will be a
good thing when it happens, because these new investors will be
compelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten
times bolder than present day VCs.</span>  <span class="s s108">And that will get us a lot more
Googles.</span>  <span class="s s109">At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.</span>

Another tip: If you want to get all that value, don't destroy the
startup after you buy it.</span>  <span class="s s113">Give the founders enough autonomy that
they can grow the acquisition into what it would have become.</span>
