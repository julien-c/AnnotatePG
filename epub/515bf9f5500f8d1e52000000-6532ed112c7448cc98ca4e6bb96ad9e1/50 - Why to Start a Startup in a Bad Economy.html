   Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy
  </span></h1>
  <h2>
   </h2><p><span class="s s2">
    October 2008
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s3">
    The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear
we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s4">
    When Microsoft and Apple were founded.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s5">As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time
to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s6">I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time
either.</span>  <span class="s s7">The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't
matter much either way.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that
they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.</span>  <span class="s s10">The
economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success
it's rounding error compared to the founders.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.</span>
<span class="s s13">If you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy.</span>
<span class="s s14">And if you're not, a good economy won't save you.</span>  <span class="s s15">Someone who
thinks "I better not start a startup now, because the economy is
so bad" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during
the Bubble "all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich.</span><span class="s s16">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s18">So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more
about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the
economy.</span>  <span class="s s19">And if you're worried about threats to the survival of
your company, don't look for them in the news.</span>  <span class="s s20">Look in the mirror.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s22">But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till
the economy is better before taking the leap?</span>  <span class="s s23">If you're starting
a restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology.</span>
<span class="s s24">Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market.</span>
<span class="s s25">So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy
will be higher than for waiting.</span>  <span class="s s26">Microsoft's first product was a
Basic interpreter for the Altair.</span>  <span class="s s27">That was exactly what the world
needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few
years, it would have been too late.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s29">Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have.</span>  <span class="s s30">There
are always new ideas.</span>  <span class="s s31">But if you have a specific idea you want to
act on, act now.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy.</span>  <span class="s s34">Both customers and investors
will be feeling pinched.</span><span class="s s35">  It's not necessarily a problem if customers
feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making
things that
    <a target="_blank" href="http://bountii.com">
     save money
    </a>
    .</span>  
<span class="s s36">Startups often make things cheaper, so in
that respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession
than big companies.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s38">Investors are more of a problem.</span>  <span class="s s39">Startups generally need to raise
some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less
willing to invest in bad times.</span>  <span class="s s40">They shouldn't be.</span>  <span class="s s41">Everyone knows
you're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are
good.</span>  <span class="s s42">But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is
that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking
it's time to buy.</span>  <span class="s s43">You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and
by definition only a minority of investors can be.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s45">So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying
to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be
reluctant to invest even in good ones.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s47">You'll have to adapt to this.</span>  <span class="s s48">But that's nothing new: startups
always have to adapt to the whims of investors.</span>  <span class="s s49">Ask any founder
in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch
the face they make.</span>  <span class="s s50">Last year you had to be prepared to explain
how your startup was viral.</span>  <span class="s s51">Next year you'll have to explain how
it's recession-proof.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s53">(Those are both good things to be.</span>  <span class="s s54">The mistake investors make is
not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one
to the exclusion of the rest.</span><span class="s s55">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do
exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.</span>
<span class="s s57">For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success
is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world.</span>  <span class="s s58">The immediate
cause of death in a startup is always running out of money.</span> <span class="s s59">So the
cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill.</span>
<span class="s s60">And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup.</span> <span class="s s61">A recession
will if anything make it cheaper still.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s63">If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach
even than to keep your job.</span>  <span class="s s64">Customers may drop off individually
if they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them
all at once; markets don't "reduce headcount.</span><span class="s s65">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s67">What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you
can't find another?</span>  <span class="s s68">That could be a problem if you work in sales or
marketing.</span>  <span class="s s69">In those fields it can take months to find a new
job in a bad economy.</span>  <span class="s s70">But hackers seem to be more liquid.</span>  <span class="s s71">Good
hackers can always get some kind of job.</span>  <span class="s s72">It might not be your dream
job, but you're not going to starve.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s74">Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition.</span>
<span class="s s75">Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals.</span>  <span class="s s76">If 
everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to
yourself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">You're an investor too.</span>  <span class="s s79">As a founder, you're buying stock with
work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that
they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they
were the first investors in Google.</span>  <span class="s s80">And like any investor you
should buy when times are bad.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s82">Were you nodding in agreement, thinking "stupid investors" a few
paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant
to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the
time they should rationally be most willing to buy?</span>  <span class="s s83">Well, founders
aren't much better.</span>  <span class="s s84">When times get bad, hackers go to grad school.</span>
<span class="s s85">And no doubt that will happen this time too.</span>  <span class="s s86">In fact, what makes
the preceding paragraph true is that most readers won't believe
it&mdash;at least to the extent of acting on it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s88">So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s89">It's hard
to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh
disadvantages like reluctant investors.</span>  <span class="s s90">But it doesn't matter much
either way.</span>   <span class="s s91">It's the people that matter.</span>  <span class="s s92">And for a given set of
people working on a given technology, the time to act is always
now.</span>
