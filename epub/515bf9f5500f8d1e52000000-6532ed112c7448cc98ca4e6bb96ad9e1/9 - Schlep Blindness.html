   Schlep Blindness
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
    January 2012
   </span></h2>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under
our noses.</span><span class="s s4">  One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call
    <i>
     schlep blindness
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s5">Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has
passed into general use in the US.</span>  <span class="s s6">It means a tedious, unpleasant
task.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.</span>  
<span class="s s9">Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing
some clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching
the money roll in-without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate
with other companies, or deal with other people's broken code.</span>
<span class="s s10">Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about
the inevitability of schleps.</span>  <span class="s s13">No, you can't start a startup by
just writing code.</span>  <span class="s s14">I remember going through this realization myself.</span>
<span class="s s15">There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myself
I could start a company by just writing code.</span>  <span class="s s16">But I soon learned
from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty
much what business consists of.</span>  <span class="s s17">A company is defined by the schleps
it will undertake.</span>  <span class="s s18">And schleps should be dealt with the same way
you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in.</span>  <span class="s s19">Which is not
to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that you
should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much
of it is unconscious.</span>  <span class="s s22">Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas
that involve painful schleps.</span>  <span class="s s23">That's schlep blindness.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">The phenomenon isn't limited to startups.</span>  <span class="s s26">Most people don't
consciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic
athletes, for example.</span>  <span class="s s27">Their unconscious mind decides for them,
shrinking from the work involved.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s29">
    The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is
    <a target="_blank" href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, or
rather Stripe's idea.</span>  <span class="s s30">For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever
had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.</span>
<span class="s s31">Thousands of people must have known about this problem.</span>  <span class="s s32">And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events.</span>  <span class="s s33">Why?</span>  <span class="s s34">Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world's infrastructure?</span>  <span class="s s35">Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea
of fixing payments.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s37">Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking "should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?</span><span class="s s38">"</span> <span class="s s39">and chose the recipe site.</span>  <span class="s s40">Though the idea of fixing payments
was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their
unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.</span>  <span class="s s41">You'd
have to make deals with banks.</span>  <span class="s s42">How do you do that?</span>  <span class="s s43">Plus you're
moving money, so you're going to have to deal with fraud, and people
trying to break into your servers.</span>  <span class="s s44">Plus there are probably all
sorts of regulations to comply with.</span>  <span class="s s45">It's a lot more intimidating
to start a startup like this than a recipe site.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s47">That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.</span>  <span class="s s48">In addition
to their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the
sense that there's less demand for them among founders.</span>  <span class="s s49">If you
pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because
everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges
involved.</span>  <span class="s s50">(This is also true of starting a startup generally.</span><span class="s s51">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s52">How do you overcome schlep blindness?</span>  <span class="s s53">Frankly, the most valuable
antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.</span>  <span class="s s54">Most successful
founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were
starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome,
they might never have started it.</span>  <span class="s s55">Maybe that's one reason the most
successful startups of all so often have young founders.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s57">In practice the founders grow with the problems.  But no one seems
able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders.</span>
<span class="s s58">So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make
two mistakes that cancel each other out.</span>  <span class="s s59">They don't know how much
they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to.</span>
<span class="s s60">Older founders only make the first mistake.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s62">Ignorance can't solve everything though.</span>  <span class="s s63">Some ideas so obviously
entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them.</span>  <span class="s s64">How do you see
ideas like that?</span>  <span class="s s65">The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of
the picture.</span>  <span class="s s66">Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?</span><span class="s s67">"</span> <span class="s s68">ask
"what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?</span><span class="s s69">"</span>  <span class="s s70">If someone
who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that,
Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s72">
    It's too late now to be Stripe, but there's plenty still broken in
the world, if you know how to see it.
