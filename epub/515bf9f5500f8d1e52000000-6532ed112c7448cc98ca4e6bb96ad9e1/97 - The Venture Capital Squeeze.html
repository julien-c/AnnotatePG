   The Venture Capital Squeeze
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   November 2005
  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">In the next few years, venture capital funds will find themselves
squeezed from four directions.</span>  <span class="s s4">They're already stuck with a seller's
market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the
Bubble and still haven't invested.</span>  <span class="s s5">This by itself is not the end
of the world.</span><span class="s s6">  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.archub.org/dilbertvc.gif">
    norm
   </a>
   in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s8">Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because
it's getting so cheap to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s9">The four causes: open
source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware
geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free
if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot
cheaper.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s11">When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest
expenses.</span>  <span class="s s12">We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,
the only software that then supported secure http connections.</span>  <span class="s s13">We
paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of
memory.</span>  <span class="s s14">And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s16">Now you could get all three for nothing.</span>  <span class="s s17">You can get the software
for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first
server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times
as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got
through the print media.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s19">
   And of course another big change for the average startup is that
programming languages have improved-- or rather, the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">
    median language
   </a>
   has.</span>  <span class="s s20">At most startups ten years
ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in
C++.</span>  <span class="s s21">Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python
or Ruby.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s23">During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would
outsource their development to India.</span>  <span class="s s24">I think a better model for
the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development
to a more powerful language instead.</span>  <span class="s s25">A lot of well-known applications
are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.</span>  <span class="s s26">And one
guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste
any time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can
pay himself nothing.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now
often want to give startups more money than the startups want to
take.</span>  <span class="s s29">VCs like to invest several million at a time.</span>  <span class="s s30">But as one
VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a
million, "I don't know what we're going to do.</span>  <span class="s s31">Maybe we'll just
have to give some of it back.</span><span class="s s32">"</span> <span class="s s33">Meaning give some of the fund back
to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't
going to be possible to invest it all.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s35">Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.</span>
<span class="s s36">Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically
increases the regulatory burden on public companies.</span> <span class="s s37">And in addition
to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a
year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate
officers.</span>  <span class="s s38">An experienced CFO I know said flatly: "I would not
want to be CFO of a public company now.</span><span class="s s39">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area
where you can't go too far.</span>  <span class="s s42">But you can go too far in any law, and
this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.</span>  <span class="s s43">This CFO
is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.</span>  <span class="s s44">If
Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  
companies, that's proof enough that it's broken.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.</span>  <span class="s s47">For
all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.</span>  <span class="s s48">Which
means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3
man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100
million to acquire.</span>   <span class="s s49">They didn't mean to be in this business; it's
just what their business has evolved into.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they
can buy wholesale.</span>  <span class="s s52">Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups
they want more expensive?</span>  <span class="s s53">Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't
want anyway.</span>  <span class="s s54">The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR
departments.</span>  <span class="s s55">What they really want is the software and the developers,
and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated
software and developers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s57">Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.</span><span class="s s58">
"Bring us your startups early," said Google's speaker at the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://startupschool.org">
    Startup School
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s59">They're quite
explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point
where they would do a Series A round.</span>  <span class="s s60">(The Series A round is the
first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first
year.</span><span class="s s61">) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology
companies will no doubt try to duplicate.</span>  <span class="s s62">Unless they want to have 
still more of their lunch eaten by Google.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s64">Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the
people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.</span>
<span class="s s65">Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;
it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich
when you're still working for salary.</span>  <span class="s s66">Even if it's the right thing   
for your company to do.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s68">
   The Solution(s)
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.</span>
<span class="s s70">They need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  
another that will seem an anathema.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s72">Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  
loosened.</span>  <span class="s s73">This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to
destroy the IPO market.</span>  <span class="s s74">Since the IPO market was practically dead
when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.</span>  <span class="s s75">But now 
that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly
what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s77">Startups are fragile plants&acirc;&#128;&#148;seedlings, in fact.</span>  <span class="s s78">These seedlings
are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the
economy.</span>  <span class="s s79">Much of the economy's growth is their growth.</span>  <span class="s s80">I think
most politicians realize that.</span>  <span class="s s81">But they don't realize just how   
fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral
damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s83">Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very
little noise.</span>  <span class="s s84">If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll
hear about it.</span>  <span class="s s85">But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,
all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in 
grad school instead of starting a company.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  
out partially in the Series A round.</span>  <span class="s s88">At the moment, when VCs invest
in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the 
money goes to the company.</span>  <span class="s s89">They could buy some stock directly from
the founders as well.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s91">Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.</span>  <span class="s s92">They
don't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes
public.</span>  <span class="s s93">VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll
have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s95">This is a dumb plan.</span>  <span class="s s96">In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock
early would generally be better for the company, because it would
cause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the
VCs'.</span>  <span class="s s97">As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend
to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would
prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,
while the VCs can afford to be "rational" and prefer the latter.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s99">Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies
early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up
front.</span>  <span class="s s100">That first million is just worth so much more than the
subsequent ones.</span>  <span class="s s101">If founders could sell a little stock early,
they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger
outcome.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s103">So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least
half million?</span>  <span class="s s104">The VCs would get same number of shares for the   
money.</span>  <span class="s s105">So what if some of the money would go to the  
founders instead of the company?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s107">Some VCs will say this is
unthinkable&acirc;&#128;&#148;that they want all their money to be put to work
growing the company.</span><span class="s s108">  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC
investments is dictated by the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html">
    structure
   </a>
   of VC funds, not the needs of startups.</span>  <span class="s s109">Often as not these large  
investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing
it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell
some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone.</span> 
<span class="s s112">The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.</span>
<span class="s s113">And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness
of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a
motivator.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s115">If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially
cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you
are now competing directly with Google.</span>
