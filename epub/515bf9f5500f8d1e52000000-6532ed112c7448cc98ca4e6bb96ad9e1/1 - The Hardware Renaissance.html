   The Hardware Renaissance
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">

  <p>
   <span class="s s3">One advantage of Y Combinator's early, broad focus is that we
see trends before most other people.</span>  <span class="s s4">And one of the most conspicuous
trends in the last batch was the large number of hardware startups.</span>
<span class="s s5">Out of 84 companies, 7 were making hardware.</span>  <span class="s s6">On the whole
they've done better than the companies that weren't.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s8">They've faced resistance from investors of course.</span>  <span class="s s9">Investors have
a deep-seated bias against hardware.</span>  <span class="s s10">But investors' opinions are
a trailing indicator.</span>  <span class="s s11">The best founders are better at seeing the
future than the best investors, because the best founders are making
it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">There is no one single force driving this trend.</span><span class="s s14">  Hardware

    does
well
   </a>
   on crowdfunding sites.</span><span class="s s15">  The spread of
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/tablets.html">
    tablets
   </a>
   makes it
possible to build new things
   <a target="_blank" href="http://lockitron.com">
    controlled
by
   </a>
   and even
   <a target="_blank" href="http://doublerobotics.com">
    incorporating
   </a>
   them.</span><span class="s s16">
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">
    Electric motors
   </a>
   have improved.</span>
<span class="s s17">Wireless connectivity of various types can now be taken for granted.</span>
<span class="s s18">It's getting more straightforward to get things manufactured.</span>
<span class="s s19">Arduinos, 3D printing, laser cutters, and more accessible CNC milling are making hardware easier to prototype.</span>
<span class="s s20">Retailers are less of a bottleneck as customers increasingly buy
online.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">One question I can answer is why hardware is suddenly cool.</span>
<span class="s s23">It always was cool.</span>
<span class="s s24">Physical things are great.</span><span class="s s25">  They just haven't
been as great a way to start a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/growth.html">
    rapidly growing
   </a>
   business
as software.</span>  <span class="s s26">But that rule may not be permanent.</span>  <span class="s s27">It's not even
that old; it only dates from about 1990.</span>  <span class="s s28">Maybe the advantage
of software will turn out to have been temporary.</span>  <span class="s s29">Hackers love to
build hardware, and customers love to buy it.</span>  <span class="s s30">So if the ease of
shipping hardware even approached the ease of shipping software,
we'd see a lot more hardware startups.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s32">It wouldn't be the first time something was a bad idea till it
wasn't.</span>  <span class="s s33">And it wouldn't be the first time investors learned that
lesson from founders.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s35">So if you want to work on hardware, don't be deterred from doing
it because you worry investors will discriminate against you.</span><span class="s s36">  And
in particular, don't be deterred from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/apply.html">
    applying
   </a>
   to Y Combinator
with a hardware idea, because we're especially interested in hardware
startups.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s38">
   We know there's room for the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">
    next Steve Jobs
   </a>
   .</span>
<span class="s s39">But there's almost certainly also room for the first
