    The Island Test
   </span></h1>
   </h2><p><span class="s s2">
    July 2006
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">I've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you're addicted
to.</span>  <span class="s s4">Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house
on a little island off the coast of Maine.</span>  <span class="s s5">There are no shops on
the island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.</span>  <span class="s s6">Also,
you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will
have more than any house might.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?</span>
<span class="s s9">That's what you're addicted to.</span>  <span class="s s10">For example, if you find yourself
packing a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and
think about that.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s12">
    For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a
pen.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s13">There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,
or tea, but I can live without them.</span>  <span class="s s14">I'm not so addicted to caffeine
that I wouldn't risk the house not having any tea, just for a
weekend.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s16">Quiet is another matter.</span>  <span class="s s17">I realize it seems a bit eccentric to
take earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.</span>  <span class="s s18">If
anywhere should be quiet, that should.</span>  <span class="s s19">But what if the person in
the next room snored?</span>  <span class="s s20">What if there was a kid playing basketball?</span>
<span class="s s21">(Thump, thump, thump.</span><span class="s s22">.</span><span class="s s23">.</span> <span class="s s24">thump.</span><span class="s s25">)  Why risk it?</span>  <span class="s s26">Earplugs are small.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">Sometimes I can think with noise.</span>  <span class="s s29">If I already have momentum on
some project, I can work in noisy places.</span>  <span class="s s30">I can edit an essay or
debug code in an airport.</span>  <span class="s s31">But airports are not so bad: most of the
noise is whitish.</span>  <span class="s s32">I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming
through the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s34">And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting
something new, that requires complete quiet.</span>   <span class="s s35">You never
know when this will strike.</span> <span class="s s36">It's just as well to carry plugs.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s38">The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.</span>  <span class="s s39">Though
actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that
their main purpose is to make me feel better.</span>  <span class="s s40">I hardly ever go
back and read stuff I write down in notebooks.</span>  <span class="s s41">It's just that if
I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets
in the way of having the next.</span>  <span class="s s42">Pen and paper wick ideas.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s44">The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.</span>
<span class="s s45">I use their smallest size, which is about 2.</span><span class="s s46">5 x 4 in.</span>
<span class="s s47">The secret to writing on such
narrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like
a Latin inscription.</span>  <span class="s s48">I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,
partly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and
partly so I don't worry about losing them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s50">I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.</span>  <span class="s s51">Before
that I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.</span>  <span class="s s52">But the problem
with scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.</span>  <span class="s s53">In a notebook
you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages
around it.</span>  <span class="s s54">In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd
written years before that might say something I needed to remember,
if I could only figure out what.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">As for books, I know the house would probably have something to
read.</span>  <span class="s s57">On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of
them, because I find new books to read en route.</span>  <span class="s s58">Really bringing
books is insurance.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s60">I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good&mdash;that what
I need them for is distraction.</span>  <span class="s s61">The books I bring on trips are
often quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned
reading in a college class.</span>  <span class="s s62">But I know my motives aren't virtuous.</span>
<span class="s s63">I bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able
to slip into another distilled by some writer.</span>  <span class="s s64">It's like eating
jam when you know you should be eating fruit.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s66">There is a point where I'll do without books.</span>  <span class="s s67">I was walking in
some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I
was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.</span>  <span class="s s68">It wasn't
so bad.</span>  <span class="s s69">I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead
of reading other people's.</span>  <span class="s s70">If you stop eating jam, fruit starts
to taste better.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s72">So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.</span>  <span class="s s73">They're
going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.</span>
