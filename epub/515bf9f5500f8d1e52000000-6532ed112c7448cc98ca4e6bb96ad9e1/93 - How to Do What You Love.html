   How to Do What You Love

   <p>
    <span class="s s3">To do something well you have to like it.</span>   <span class="s s4">That idea is not exactly
novel.</span>  <span class="s s5">We've got it down to four words: "Do what you love.</span><span class="s s6">"</span>  <span class="s s7">But
it's not enough just to tell people that.</span>  <span class="s s8">Doing what you love is
complicated.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s10">The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.</span>  <span class="s s11">When I
was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.</span>
<span class="s s12">Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do
things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could
do what you wanted, and that was called playing.</span>  <span class="s s13">Occasionally the
things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing
wasn't&acirc;&#128;&#148;for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.</span>  <span class="s s14">But except
for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as
not-fun.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s16">And it did not seem to be an accident.</span><span class="s s17"> School, it was implied, was
tedious
    <i>
     because
    </i>
    it was preparation for grownup work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s19">The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.</span>
<span class="s s20">Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.</span>  <span class="s s21">Kids didn't,
but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of
work meant to prepare us for the real thing.</span>  <span class="s s22">Much as we disliked
school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and
that we had it easy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s24">Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work
was not fun.</span>  <span class="s s25">Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of
them.</span>  <span class="s s26">Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing
dodgeball?</span>  <span class="s s27">For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of
kids instead of lying on a beach.</span>  <span class="s s28">You couldn't just do what you
wanted.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.</span>
<span class="s s31">They may have to be made to work on certain things.</span>  <span class="s s32">But if we make
kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness
is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason
they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more
interesting stuff later.</span><span class="s s33">

   <p>
    <span class="s s34">Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever
I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.</span>  <span class="s s35">I remember that
precisely because it seemed so anomalous.</span>  <span class="s s36">It was like being told
to use dry water.</span><span class="s s37">  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he
meant work could
    <i>
     literally
    </i>
    be fun&acirc;&#128;&#148;fun like playing.</span>  <span class="s s38">It
took me years to grasp that.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s40">
    Jobs
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s41">By high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.</span>
<span class="s s42">Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we
would go to see them at work.</span>  <span class="s s43">It was always understood that they
enjoyed what they did.</span>  <span class="s s44">In retrospect I think one may have: the
private jet pilot.</span>  <span class="s s45">But I don't think the bank manager really did.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s47">The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was
presumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed
to.</span>  <span class="s s48">It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you
despised your job, but a social faux-pas.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s50">Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?</span>  <span class="s s51">The first
sentence of this essay explains that.</span>  <span class="s s52">If you have to like something
to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what
they do.</span>  <span class="s s53">That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.</span><span class="s s54">
Just as houses all over America are full of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=louis%20xv%20chair">
     chairs
    </a>
    that are, without
the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed
250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work
are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of
the attitudes of people who've done great things.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">What a recipe for alienation.</span>  <span class="s s57">By the time they reach an age to
think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly
misled about the idea of loving one's work.</span>  <span class="s s58">School has trained
them to regard work as an unpleasant duty.</span>  <span class="s s59">Having a job is said
to be even more onerous than schoolwork.</span>  <span class="s s60">And yet all the adults
claim to like what they do.</span>  <span class="s s61">You can't blame kids for thinking "I
am not like these people; I am not suited to this world.</span><span class="s s62">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s64">Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught
to regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not
(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around
them are lying when they say they like what they do.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s66">The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents.</span>  <span class="s s67">If you take
a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so
many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that
work is boring.</span><span class="s s68">

                                  Maybe it would be better for kids in this one
case if parents were not so unselfish.</span>  <span class="s s69">A parent who set an example
of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive
house.</span><span class="s s70">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s71">It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke
free from the idea of making a living.</span>  <span class="s s72">Then the important question
became not how to make money, but what to work on.</span>  <span class="s s73">Ideally these
coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in
the patent office) proved they weren't identical.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">The definition of work was now to make some original contribution
to the world, and in the process not to starve.</span>  <span class="s s76">But after the habit
of so many years my idea of work still included a large component
of pain.</span>  <span class="s s77">Work still seemed to require discipline, because only
hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't
literally be fun.</span>   <span class="s s78">Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s80">If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to
notice if you're doing it wrong.</span>  <span class="s s81">That about sums up my experience
of graduate school.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s83">
    Bounds
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s84">
    <i>
     How much
    </i>
    are you supposed to like what you do?</span>  <span class="s s85">Unless you
know that, you don't know when to stop searching.</span> <span class="s s86">And if, like most
people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too
early.</span>  <span class="s s87">You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,
or the desire to make money, or prestige&acirc;&#128;&#148;or sheer inertia.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s89">
    Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you
would like to do most
    <i>
     this second
    </i>
    .</span>  <span class="s s90">Even Einstein probably
had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself
he ought to finish what he was working on first.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they
did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do.</span><span class="s s93">  There didn't
seem to be any sort of work I liked
    <i>
     that
    </i>
    much.</span>  <span class="s s94">If I had a
choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)
be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was
there any sort of work I'd prefer?</span>  <span class="s s95">Honestly, no.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s97">But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,
float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious
food, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what you
love assumes a certain length of time.</span>  <span class="s s98">It doesn't mean, do what
will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest
over some longer period, like a week or a month.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s100">Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.</span>  <span class="s s101">After a while you get tired
of lying on the beach.</span>  <span class="s s102">If you want to stay happy, you have to do
something.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s104">As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive
pleasure.</span>  <span class="s s105">You have to like what you do enough that the concept of
"spare time" seems mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s106">Which is not to say you have to spend
all your time working.</span>  <span class="s s107">You can only work so much before you get
tired and start to screw up.</span>  <span class="s s108">Then you want to do something else&acirc;&#128;&#148;even something mindless.</span>  <span class="s s109">But you don't regard this time as the
prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn
it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s111">I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.</span>  <span class="s s112">If your work
is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems
with procrastination.</span>  <span class="s s113">You'll have to force yourself to work,  and
when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s115">To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only
enjoy, but admire.</span>  <span class="s s116">You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,
that's pretty cool.</span>  <span class="s s117">This doesn't mean you have to make something.</span>
<span class="s s118">If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language
fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,
wow, that's pretty cool.</span>  <span class="s s119">What there has to be is a test.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s121">So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is
reading books.</span>  <span class="s s122">Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,
there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why
merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.</span>  <span class="s s123">You have to do
something with what you've read to feel productive.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s125">I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things
that would make your friends say wow.</span>  <span class="s s126">But it probably wouldn't
start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't
had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s128">
    Sirens
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s129">What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of
anyone beyond your friends.</span>  <span class="s s130">You shouldn't worry about prestige.</span>
<span class="s s131">Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.</span>  <span class="s s132">When you can ask
the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it
add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know?</span><span class="s s133">
                                                                  
                                                                   [

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s134">This is easy advice to give.</span>  <span class="s s135">It's hard to follow, especially when
you're young.</span><span class="s s136">
                                                                    
                                                                     [
    <a name="f5" href="#f5n">

    </a>
    ]
                                                                    
                                                                    Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps
even your beliefs about what you enjoy.</span>  <span class="s s137">It causes you to work not
on what you like, but what you'd like to like.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s139">That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example.</span>  <span class="s s140">They
like reading novels.</span>  <span class="s s141">They notice that people who write them win
Nobel prizes.</span>  <span class="s s142">What could be more wonderful, they think, than to
be a novelist?</span>  <span class="s s143">But liking the idea of being a novelist is not
enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're
going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s145">Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.</span><span class="s s146">  If you do anything well
enough, you'll
    <i>
     make
    </i>
    it prestigious.</span>  <span class="s s147">Plenty of things we now
consider prestigious were anything but at first.</span>  <span class="s s148">Jazz comes to
mind&acirc;&#128;&#148;though almost any established art form would do.</span>   <span class="s s149">So just
do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s151">Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.</span>  <span class="s s152">If you want to
make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do
it is to bait the hook with prestige.</span>  <span class="s s153">That's the recipe for getting
people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be
department heads, and so on.</span>  <span class="s s154">It might be a good rule simply to
avoid any prestigious task.</span> <span class="s s155">If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have
had to make it prestigious.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s157">Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more
prestigious, you should probably choose the other.</span>  <span class="s s158">Your opinions
about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced
by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have
more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s160">The other big force leading people astray is money.</span>  <span class="s s161">Money by itself
is not that dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s162">When something pays well but is regarded
with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal
injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it.</span>  <span class="s s163">That
kind of work ends up being done by people who are "just trying to
make a living.</span><span class="s s164">"</span>  <span class="s s165">(Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say
this.</span><span class="s s166">)  The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in,
say, corporate law, or medicine.</span>  <span class="s s167">A comparatively safe and prosperous
career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting
to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really
like.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s169">The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do
it even if they weren't paid for it&acirc;&#128;&#148;even if they had to work at
another job to make a living.</span>  <span class="s s170">How many corporate lawyers would do
their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare
time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s172">This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds
of academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.</span>  <span class="s s173">Most
good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs
as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of
the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver:
people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies,
and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.</span>  <span class="s s174">Math
would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of
English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into
being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity
in the novels of Conrad.</span><span class="s s175">  No one does
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/scholar?q=gender+identity+narrative+discourse+transcend">
     that
    </a>
    kind of thing for fun.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s177">The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.</span>  <span class="s s178">It
seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists
and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors
and whose parents want them to be novelists.</span>  <span class="s s179">The kids think their
parents are "materialistic.</span><span class="s s180">"</span> <span class="s s181">Not necessarily.</span>  <span class="s s182">All parents tend to
be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves,
simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.</span>  <span class="s s183">If
your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage
daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share
in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets
pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s185">
    Discipline
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s186">With such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising
we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on.</span>  <span class="s s187">Most people
are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain.</span>
<span class="s s188">Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige
or money.</span>  <span class="s s189">How many even discover something they love to work on?</span>
<span class="s s190">A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s192">It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do.</span>  <span class="s s193">So don't
underestimate this task.</span>  <span class="s s194">And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded
yet.</span>  <span class="s s195">In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented,
you're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.</span>  <span class="s s196">If
you're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you
find contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves.</span>  <span class="s s197">Not
necessarily, but probably.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s199">
    Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think&acirc;&#128;&#148;because the way to do great work is to find something you like so
much that you don't have to force yourself to do it&acirc;&#128;&#148;
    <i>
     finding
    </i>
    work you love does usually require discipline.</span>   <span class="s s200">Some people are
lucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just
glide along as if they were on railroad tracks.</span>  <span class="s s201">But this seems the
exception.</span>  <span class="s s202">More often people who do great things have careers with
the trajectory of a ping-pong ball.</span>  <span class="s s203">They go to school to study A,
drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after
taking it up on the side.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s205">Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of
energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness.</span>  <span class="s s206">Are you dropping
out, or boldly carving a new path?</span>  <span class="s s207">You often can't tell yourself.</span>
<span class="s s208">Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments
early on, when they're trying to find their niche.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s210">Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?</span>  <span class="s s211">One is to
try to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't
like it.</span>  <span class="s s212">Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction
as an excuse for being lazy.</span>  <span class="s s213">Perhaps more importantly, you'll get
into the habit of doing things well.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s215">Another test you can use is: always produce.</span>  <span class="s s216">For example, if you
have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a
novelist, are you producing?</span>  <span class="s s217">Are you writing pages of fiction,
however bad?</span>  <span class="s s218">As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not
merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write
one day as an opiate.</span>  <span class="s s219">The view of it will be obstructed by the all
too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s221">"Always produce" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love.</span>
<span class="s s222">If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically
push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on,
toward things you actually like.</span>  <span class="s s223">"Always produce" will discover
your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the
hole in your roof.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s225">Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you
get to work on it.</span>  <span class="s s226">That's a separate question.</span>  <span class="s s227">And if you're
ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious
effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated
by what seems possible.</span><span class="s s228">
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                       [

   <p>
    <span class="s s229">It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe
the gap between them.</span> <span class="s s230">So most people pre-emptively lower their
expectations.</span>  <span class="s s231">For example, if you asked random people on the street
if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most
would say something like "Oh, I can't draw.</span><span class="s s232">"</span>  <span class="s s233">This is more a statement
of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try.</span>  <span class="s s234">Because
the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow
got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the
next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far.</span>  <span class="s s235">But it would require
a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every
day for years.</span>  <span class="s s236">And so to protect themselves people say "I can't.</span><span class="s s237">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s239">Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do
work they love&acirc;&#128;&#148;that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.</span>  <span class="s s240">Really?</span>
<span class="s s241">How do you make them?</span>  <span class="s s242">In the US the only mechanism for forcing
people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn't been
invoked for over 30 years.</span>  <span class="s s243">All we can do is encourage people to
do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s245">If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society
just has to make do without.</span>  <span class="s s246">That's what happened with domestic
servants.</span>  <span class="s s247">For millennia that was the canonical example of a job
"someone had to do.</span><span class="s s248">"</span>  <span class="s s249">And yet in the mid twentieth century servants
practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just
had to do without.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s251">So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good
chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.</span>
<span class="s s252">Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no
one were willing to do them.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s254">
    Two Routes
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s255">There's another sense of "not everyone can do work they love"
that's all too true, however.</span>  <span class="s s256">One has to make a living, and it's
hard to get paid for doing work you love.</span>  <span class="s s257">There are two routes to
that destination:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s258">The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to
  increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of
  those you don't.</span>
    </blockquote>
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s260">The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money
  to work on things you do.</span>
    <span class="s s261">The organic route is more common.</span>  <span class="s s262">It happens naturally to anyone
who does good work.</span>  <span class="s s263">A young architect has to take whatever work
he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position
to pick and choose among projects.</span>  <span class="s s264">The disadvantage of this route
is that it's slow and uncertain.</span>  <span class="s s265">Even tenure is not real freedom.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s267">The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you
work for money at a time.</span>  <span class="s s268">At one extreme is the "day job," where
you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what
you love in your spare time.</span><span class="s s269">  At the other extreme you work at
something till you make
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">
     enough
    </a>
    not to 
have to work for money again.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s271">The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because
it requires a deliberate choice.</span>  <span class="s s272">It's also more dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s273">Life
tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get
sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.</span>
<span class="s s274">Worse still, anything you work on changes you.</span>  <span class="s s275">If you work too
long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.</span>  <span class="s s276">And the best paying
jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s278">The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over
obstacles.</span>  <span class="s s279">The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are
walls of varying heights between different kinds of work.</span><span class="s s280">
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                         [

                                                                                                                        The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you
from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music.</span>
<span class="s s281">If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you
have more freedom of choice.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s283">Which route should you take?</span>  <span class="s s284">That depends on how sure you are of
what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much
risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your
lifetime) for what you want to do.</span>  <span class="s s285">If you're sure of the general
area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to
pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route.</span>  <span class="s s286">But
if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take
orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand
the risk.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s288">Don't decide too soon.</span>  <span class="s s289">Kids who know early what they want to do
seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question
before the other kids.</span>  <span class="s s290">They have an answer, certainly, but odds
are it's wrong.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s292">A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly
about her job.</span>  <span class="s s293">When people applying to medical school ask her for
advice, she wants to shake them and yell "Don't do it!</span><span class="s s294">"</span>  <span class="s s295">(But she
never does.</span><span class="s s296">) How did she get into this fix?</span>  <span class="s s297">In high school she
already wanted to be a doctor.</span>  <span class="s s298">And she is so ambitious and determined
that she overcame every obstacle along the way&acirc;&#128;&#148;including,
unfortunately, not liking it.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s300">
    Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s301">When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get
enough information to make each choice before you need to make it.</span>
<span class="s s302">But this is certainly not so with work.</span>  <span class="s s303">When you're deciding what
to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.</span>
<span class="s s304">Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are
like.</span>  <span class="s s305">At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs
offer internships, and those that do don't teach you much more about
the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s307">In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you
get better results if you use flexible media.</span>  <span class="s s308">So unless you're
fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a
type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job
career.</span>  <span class="s s309">That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.</span>
<span class="s s310">You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into
any number of other kinds of work.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s312">It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different
things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.</span>
<span class="s s313">Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous
because it teaches you so little about what you like.</span>  <span class="s s314">If you work
hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll
quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when
you quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing
novels?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s316">Most people would say, I'd take that problem.</span>  <span class="s s317">Give me a million
dollars and I'll figure out what to do.</span>  <span class="s s318">But it's harder than it
looks.</span>  <span class="s s319">Constraints give your life shape.</span>  <span class="s s320">Remove them and most
people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who
win lotteries or inherit money.</span>  <span class="s s321">Much as everyone thinks they want
financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it,
but those who like what they do.</span>  <span class="s s322">So a plan that promises freedom
at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as
it seems.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s323">Whichever route you take, expect a struggle.</span>  <span class="s s324">Finding work you love
is very difficult.</span>  <span class="s s325">Most people fail.</span>  <span class="s s326">Even if you succeed, it's
rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or
forties.</span>  <span class="s s327">But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more
likely to arrive at it.</span>  <span class="s s328">If you know you can love work, you're in
the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're
practically there.</span>

concealing from his family how much he liked his work.</span>  <span class="s s334">When he
wanted to go to work on a saturday, he found it easier to say that

he preferred to work than stay home with them.</span>

Donald Hall said young would-be poets were mistaken to be so
obsessed with being published.</span><span class="s s344">  But you can imagine what it would
do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in

no better or worse than he was before, but to a clueless audience
like that, the approval of an official authority makes all the
difference.</span>   <span class="s s347">So it's a harder problem than Hall realizes.</span>  <span class="s s348">The
