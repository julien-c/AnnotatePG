   <p>
    <!-- <i>(This 
article is meant to be a complete summary of funding options
for startup founders.  In effect we're open-sourcing the kernel of
what we tell founders about funding at <nota href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
Combinator</a>.)</i>
--><span class="s s3">
    Venture funding works like gears.  A typical startup goes through
several rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just
enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next
gear.
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s4">
    Few startups get it quite right.  Many are underfunded.  A few are
overfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s5">I think it would help founders to understand funding better&acirc;&#128;&#148;not
just the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking.</span>  <span class="s s6">I was
surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we
faced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors.</span>
<span class="s s7">Dealing with competitors was easy by comparison.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">I don't mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag
on us.</span>  <span class="s s10">They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example.</span>  <span class="s s11">I
mean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty.</span>
<span class="s s12">Competitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the
balls.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s14">Apparently our situation was not unusual.</span>  <span class="s s15">And if trouble with
investors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing them
is one of the most important skills founders need to learn.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s17">Let's start by talking about the five sources of startup funding.</span>
<span class="s s18">Then we'll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startup
as it shifts gears through successive rounds.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s20">
    Friends and Family
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family.</span>
<span class="s s22">Excite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college,
they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company.</span>  <span class="s s23">With
the help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between
them and angel investors.</span>  <span class="s s26">At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 of
seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently rich
that it's hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend
or angel.</span>  <span class="s s27">He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meant
we didn't have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s29">The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that
they're easy to find.</span>  <span class="s s30">You already know them.</span>  <span class="s s31">There are three main
disadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life;
they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture
firms; and they may not be accredited investors, which could
complicate your life later.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">The SEC defines an "accredited investor" as someone with over a
million dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 a
year.</span>  <span class="s s34">The regulatory burden is much lower if a company's shareholders
are all accredited investors.</span>  <span class="s s35">Once you take money from the general
public you're more restricted in what you can do.</span><span class="s s36">
                            
                             [
    <a name="f1" href="#f1n">

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s37">A startup's life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the
investors aren't accredited.</span>  <span class="s s38">In an IPO, it might not merely add
expense, but change the outcome.</span> <span class="s s39">A lawyer I asked about it said:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s40">When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all
  prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take
  immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws.</span>
  <span class="s s41">Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s43">
    Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small.
But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end up
going public didn't seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed
that the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling
plans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the
decade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny
probability multiplied by the huge outcome.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s44">It wasn't because they weren't accredited investors that I didn't
ask my parents for seed money, though.</span>  <span class="s s45">When we were starting Viaweb,
I didn't know about the concept of an accredited investor, and
didn't stop to think about the value of investors' connections.</span>
<span class="s s46">The reason I didn't take money from my parents was that I didn't
want them to lose it.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s48">
    Consulting
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s49">Another way to fund a startup is to get a job.</span>  <span class="s s50">The best sort of
job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software
you wanted to sell as a startup.</span>  <span class="s s51">Then you can gradually transform
yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have
your clients pay your development expenses.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s53">This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most
of the risk out of starting a startup.</span>  <span class="s s54">There never has to be a
time when you have no revenues.</span>  <span class="s s55">Risk and reward are usually
proportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk
of starting a startup also to cut the average return.</span>  <span class="s s56">In this case,
you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your
company won't succeed as a startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s58">But isn't the consulting company itself a startup?</span>  <span class="s s59">No, not generally.</span>
<span class="s s60">A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a
startup.</span>  <span class="s s61">There are millions of small businesses in America, but
only a few thousand are startups.</span>  <span class="s s62">To be a startup, a company has
to be a product business, not a service business.</span>  <span class="s s63">By which I mean
not that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have
one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work
for individual clients.</span>  <span class="s s64">Custom work doesn't scale.</span>  <span class="s s65">To be a startup
you need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, not
the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar
mitzvahs.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s67">The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit
of calling you on the phone.</span>  <span class="s s68">Most startups operate close to the
margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients
could be enough to put you over the edge.</span>  <span class="s s69">Especially if you have
competitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s71">So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route.</span>
<span class="s s72">You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a
"weed tree," dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money.</span><span class="s s73">
                                            
                                             [

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s74">Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you
an excuse for failure.</span>  <span class="s s75">In a startup, as in grad school, a lot of
what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and
friends.</span>  <span class="s s76">Once you start a startup and tell everyone that's what
you're doing, you're now on a path labelled "get rich or bust.</span><span class="s s77">"</span> <span class="s s78">You
now have to get rich, or you've failed.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s80">Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force.</span>  <span class="s s81">Usually it
prevents people from starting things, but once you publish some
definite ambition, it switches directions and starts working in
your favor.</span>  <span class="s s82">I think it's a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set
this irresistible force against the slightly less immovable object
of becoming rich.</span>  <span class="s s83">You won't have it driving you if your stated
ambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one
day morph into a startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s85">An advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is that
you know you're making something at least one customer wants.</span>  <span class="s s86">But
if you have what it takes to start a startup you should have
sufficient vision not to need this crutch.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s88">
    Angel Investors
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s89">
    <i>
     Angels
    </i>
    are individual rich people.</span>  <span class="s s90">The word was first used
for backers of Broadway plays, but now applies to individual investors
generally.</span>  <span class="s s91">Angels who've made money in technology are preferable,
for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they're a
source of contacts and advice.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s93">The contacts and advice can be more important than the money.</span>  <span class="s s94">When
del.</span><span class="s s95">icio.</span><span class="s s96">us took money from investors, they took money from, among
others, Tim O'Reilly.</span>  <span class="s s97">The amount he put in was small compared to
the VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guy
and it's good to have him on your side.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s99">You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends
and family.</span><span class="s s100">  With angels we're now talking about venture funding
proper, so it's time to introduce the concept of
    <i>
     exit strategy
    </i>
    .</span>
<span class="s s101">Younger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expect
them either to sell the company or go public.</span>  <span class="s s102">The reason is that
investors need to get their capital back.</span>  <span class="s s103">They'll only consider
companies that have an exit strategy&acirc;&#128;&#148;meaning companies that could
get bought or go public.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">This is not as selfish as it sounds.</span>  <span class="s s106">There are few large, private
technology companies.</span>  <span class="s s107">Those that don't fail all seem to get bought
or go public.</span>  <span class="s s108">The reason is that employees are investors too&acirc;&#128;&#148;of
their time&acirc;&#128;&#148;and they want just as much to be able to cash out.</span>  <span class="s s109">If
your competitors offer employees stock options that might make them
rich, while you make it clear you plan to stay private, your
competitors will get the best people.</span> <span class="s s110">So the principle of an "exit"
is not just something forced on startups by investors, but part of
what it means to be a startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s112">Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation.</span>  <span class="s s113">When someone
buys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value for
it.</span>  <span class="s s114">If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a company, the company is
in theory worth $200,000.</span>  <span class="s s115">I say "in theory" because in early stage
investing, valuations are voodoo.</span>  <span class="s s116">As a company gets more established,
its valuation gets closer to an actual market value.</span>  <span class="s s117">But in a newly
founded startup, the valuation number is just an artifact of the
respective contributions of everyone involved.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s119">Startups often "pay" investors who will help the company in some
way by letting them invest at low valuations.</span>  <span class="s s120">If I had a startup
and Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I'd give him the stock for
$10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor.</span>  <span class="s s121">Unfortunately,
it's impractical (if not illegal) to adjust the valuation of the
company up and down for each investor.</span>  <span class="s s122">Startups' valuations are
supposed to rise over time.</span>  <span class="s s123">So if you're going to sell cheap stock
to eminent angels, do it early, when it's natural for the company
to have a low valuation.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s125">Some angel investors join together in syndicates.</span>  <span class="s s126">Any city where
people start startups will have one or more of them.</span><span class="s s127">  In Boston the
biggest is the

                                                                  However, most angel investors don't belong to these groups.</span>  <span class="s s131">In
fact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to
belong to a group.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s133">
    Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them.
Needless to say, you should never do this.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s134">One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels,
rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they
have less reputation to protect.</span>  <span class="s s135">A big-name VC firm will not screw
you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if
word got out.</span>  <span class="s s136">With individual angels you don't have this protection,
as we found to our dismay in our own startup.</span>  <span class="s s137">In many startups'
lives there comes a point when you're at the investors' 
mercy&acirc;&#128;&#148;when you're out of money and the only place to get more is your
existing investors.</span>  <span class="s s138">When we got into such a scrape, our investors
took advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn't
have.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s140">Angels have a corresponding advantage, however: they're also not
bound by all the rules that VC firms are.</span>  <span class="s s141">And so they can, for
example, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round,
by selling some of their stock directly to the investors.</span>  <span class="s s142">I think
this will become more common; the average founder is eager to do
it, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock will
not, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed to
the business.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s144">The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and so
on balance I'm grateful rather than angry.</span>  <span class="s s145">(As in families, relations
between founders and investors can be complicated.</span><span class="s s146">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s147">The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions.</span>
<span class="s s148">You could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, like
VCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they
respect.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s150">Deal terms with angels vary a lot.</span>  <span class="s s151">There are no generally accepted
standards.</span>  <span class="s s152">Sometimes angels' deal terms are as fearsome as VCs'.</span>
<span class="s s153">Other angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest based
on a two-page agreement.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s155">Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what
terms they want.</span>  <span class="s s156">They just want to invest in this startup.</span>  <span class="s s157">What
kind of anti-dilution protection do they want?</span>  <span class="s s158">Hell if they know.</span>
<span class="s s159">In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel
asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms end
up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.</span>  <span class="s s160">Which in practice
usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around
his firm.</span>  <span class="s s161">(Few legal documents are created from scratch.</span><span class="s s162">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s163">These heaps o' boilerplate are a problem for small startups, because
they tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents.</span>  <span class="s s164">I
know of one startup that got from an angel investor what amounted
to a five hundred pound handshake: after deciding to invest, the
angel presented them with a 70-page agreement.</span>  <span class="s s165">The startup didn't
have enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it, let alone negotiate
the terms, so the deal fell through.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s167">One solution to this problem would be to have the startup's lawyer
produce the agreement, instead of the angel's.</span>  <span class="s s168">Some angels might
balk at this, but others would probably welcome it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s170">Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to
write that big check.</span>  <span class="s s171">In our startup, one of the two angels in the
initial round took months to pay us, and only did after repeated
nagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s173">It's obvious why investors delay.</span>  <span class="s s174">Investing in startups is risky!</span><span class="s s175">
When a company is only two months old, every
    <i>
     day
    </i>
    you wait
gives you 1.</span><span class="s s176">7% more data about their trajectory.</span>  <span class="s s177">But the investor
is already being compensated for that risk in the low price of the
stock, so it is unfair to delay.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s179">Fair or not, investors do it if you let them.</span>  <span class="s s180">Even VCs do it.</span>  <span class="s s181">And
funding delays are a big distraction for founders, who ought to be
working on their company, not worrying about investors.</span>  <span class="s s182">What's a
startup to do?</span>  <span class="s s183">With both investors and acquirers, the only leverage
you have is competition.</span>  <span class="s s184">If an investor knows you have other
investors lined up, he'll be a lot more eager to close-- and not
just because he'll worry about losing the deal, but because if other
investors are interested, you must be worth investing in.</span>  <span class="s s185">It's the
same with acquisitions.</span>  <span class="s s186">No one wants to buy you till someone else
wants to buy you, and then everyone wants to buy you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s188">The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives.</span><span class="s s189">
When an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirer
says they want to buy you,
    <i>
     don't believe it till you get the
check.
    </i>
    Your natural tendency when an investor says yes will
be to relax and go back to writing code.</span>  <span class="s s190">Alas, you can't; you have
to keep looking for more investors, if only to get this one to act.</span><span class="s s191">

   <h3><span class="s s192">
    Seed Funding Firms
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s193">Seed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small
amounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they're companies
that do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasional
investments on the side.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s195">
    Till now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called "incubators,"
so
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">
     Y Combinator
    </a>
    gets called
one too, though the only thing we have in common is that we invest
in the earliest phase.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s197">According to the National Association of Business Incubators, there
are about 800 incubators in the US.</span>  <span class="s s198">This is an astounding number,
because I know the founders of a lot of startups, and I can't think
of one that began in an incubator.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s200">What is an incubator?</span>  <span class="s s201">I'm not sure myself.</span>  <span class="s s202">The defining quality
seems to be that you work in their space.</span>  <span class="s s203">That's where the name
"incubator" comes from.</span>  <span class="s s204">They seem to vary a great deal in other
respects.</span><span class="s s205">  At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where
a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant
building as a "high-tech incubator," as if it were merely lack of
the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town
from becoming a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html">
     startup hub
    </a>
    .</span>  
<span class="s s206">At the other extreme are places like
Idealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires
people to work for them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s208">The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead,
were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the
startups they funded.</span>  <span class="s s209">In addition to working in their space, you
were supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and
so on.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s211">
    Whereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs,
Y Combinator exerts less.
    </span><!-- We just supply seed money, advice, and
introductions.  We don't want any control over the startups we fund. --><span class="s s212">
    And we think it's better if startups operate out of their own
premises, however crappy, than the offices of their investors.  So
it's annoying that we keep getting called an "incubator," but perhaps
inevitable, because there's only one of us so far and no word yet
for what we are.  If we have to be called something, the obvious
name would be "excubator." (The name is more excusable if one
considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s213">Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people,
reaching them is easier than reaching angels.</span>  <span class="s s214">Just go to their web
site and send them an email.</span>  <span class="s s215">The importance of personal introductions
varies, but is less than with angels or VCs.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s217">The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment
process is more standardized.</span>  <span class="s s218">(This is generally true with angel
groups too.</span><span class="s s219">) Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they use
for every startup they fund.</span>  <span class="s s220">The fact that the deal terms are
standard doesn't mean they're favorable to you, but if other startups
have signed the same agreements and things went well for them, it's
a sign the terms are reasonable.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s222">Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively
in the earliest phases&acirc;&#128;&#148;often when the company is still just an
idea.</span>  <span class="s s223">Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this, but they also
invest at later stages.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s225">The problems are different in the early stages.</span><span class="s s226">  For example, in
the first couple months a startup may completely redefine their
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">
     idea
    </a>
    .</span>  <span class="s s227">So seed investors usually care less
about the idea than the people.</span> <span class="s s228">This is true of all venture funding,
but especially so in the seed stage.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s230">Like VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they
offer.</span>  <span class="s s231">But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase, they
need to offer different kinds of advice.</span>  <span class="s s232">For example, a seed firm
should be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCs
obviously don't need to do; whereas VCs should be able to give
advice about how to hire an "executive team," which is not an issue
in the seed stage.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s234">In the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so
seed firms should be able to help with technical as well as business
problems.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s235">Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the
initial phases of a startup, then hand them off to VC firms for the
next round.</span>  <span class="s s236">Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct to
acquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasingly
common.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s238">
    Google has been aggressively pursuing this route, and now
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/buckman.html">
     Yahoo
    </a>
    is too.</span>  <span class="s s239">Both
now compete directly with VCs.</span>  <span class="s s240">And this is a smart move.</span>  <span class="s s241">Why wait
for further funding rounds to jack up a startup's price?</span>  <span class="s s242">When a
startup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to
invest in it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy
it.</span>  <span class="s s243">More information, in fact; with their technical depth, the
acquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s245">
    Venture Capital Funds
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s246">VC firms are like seed firms in that they're actual companies, but
they invest other people's money, and much larger amounts of it.</span>
<span class="s s247">VC investments average several million dollars.</span>  <span class="s s248">So they tend to
come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come
with tougher terms.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s249">
    The word "venture capitalist" is sometimes used loosely for any
venture investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs and
other investors: VC firms are organized as
    <i>
     funds
    </i>
    , much like
hedge funds or mutual funds.</span>  <span class="s s250">The fund managers, who are called
"general partners," get about 2% of the fund annually as a management
fee, plus about 20% of the fund's gains.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s252">There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, because
in the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating.</span>
<span class="s s253">When an investment scores spectacularly, as Google did for Kleiner
and Sequoia, it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs.</span>  <span class="s s254">And
many founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, because
of the legitimacy it confers.</span>  <span class="s s255">Hence a vicious (for the losers)
cycle:  VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the deals
the bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s257">As a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, only
about 50 are likely to make money, and it is very hard for a new
fund to break into this group.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s259">In a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders.</span>
<span class="s s260">They may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big-name
firms, but they are much hungrier for deals.</span>  <span class="s s261">This means you should
be able to get better terms from them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s263">Better how?</span>  <span class="s s264">The most obvious is valuation: they'll take less of
your company.</span>  <span class="s s265">But as well as money, there's power.</span>  <span class="s s266">I think founders
will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms that will
make it fairly hard to fire them later.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s268">
    The most dramatic change, I predict,
is that VCs will allow founders to 
cash out partially by
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html">
     selling
    </a>
    some of their stock direct to the VC firm.</span>  <span class="s s269">VCs have traditionally
resisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate "liquidity
event.</span><span class="s s270">"</span>  <span class="s s271">But they're also desperate for deals.</span>  <span class="s s272">And since I know
from my own experience that the rule against buying stock from
founders is a stupid one, this is a natural place for things to
give as venture funding becomes more and more a seller's market.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s274">The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that
people will assume, correctly or not, that you were turned down by
the more exalted ones.</span>  <span class="s s275">But, like where you went to college, the
name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to
measure.</span>  <span class="s s276">So the more confident you are, the less you need a
brand-name VC.</span>  <span class="s s277">We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money; it never
occurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make
us seem more impressive.</span><span class="s s278">
                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                             [
    <a name="f5" href="#f5n">
     5
    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s279">Another danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they have
less reputation to protect.</span>   <span class="s s280">I suspect it's the lower-tier firms
that are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs
such a bad reputation among hackers.</span>  <span class="s s281">They are doubly hosed: the
general partners themselves are less able, and yet they have harder
problems to solve, because the top VCs skim off all the best deals,
leaving the lower-tier firms exactly the startups that are likely
to blow up.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s283">For example, lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend to
want to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide
if they really want to.</span>  <span class="s s284">One experienced CFO said:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s285">The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they
 really want to do a deal.</span> <span class="s s286">The second or third tier firms have a
 much higher break rate&acirc;&#128;&#148;it could be as high as 50%.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s288">
    It's obvious why: the lower-tier firms' biggest fear, when chance
throws them a bone, is that one of the big dogs will notice and
take it away.  The big dogs don't have worry about that.
   
   </span><p><span class="s s289">
    Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you.  As one
VC told me:
    </span></p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s290">If you were talking to four VCs, told three of them that you
  accepted a term sheet, and then have to call them back to tell
  them you were just kidding, you are absolutely damaged goods.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s292">
    Here's a partial solution: when a VC offers you a term sheet, ask
how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals.  This will
at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s293">Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners.</span>  <span class="s s294">Most firms
also have a handful of junior employees called something like
associates or analysts.</span>  <span class="s s295">If you get a call from a VC
firm, go to their web site and check whether the person you talked
to is a partner.</span>  <span class="s s296">Odds are it will be a junior person; they scour
the web looking for startups their bosses could invest in.</span>  <span class="s s297">The
junior people will tend to seem very positive about your company.</span><span class="s s298">
They're not pretending; they
    <i>
     want
    </i>
    to believe you're a hot
prospect, because it would be a huge coup for them if their firm
invested in a company they discovered.</span>  <span class="s s299">Don't be misled by this
optimism.</span>  <span class="s s300">It's the partners who decide, and they view things with
a colder eye.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s302">Because VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with more
restrictions.</span>  <span class="s s303">Most only come into effect if the company gets into
trouble.</span>  <span class="s s304">For example, VCs generally write it into the deal that
in any sale, they get their investment back first.</span>  <span class="s s305">So if the company
gets sold at a low price, the founders could get nothing.</span>  <span class="s s306">Some VCs
now require that in any sale they get 4x their investment back
before the common stock holders (that is, you) get anything, but
this is an abuse that should be resisted.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s308">Another difference with large investments is that the founders are
usually required to accept "vesting"&acirc;&#128;&#148;to surrender their stock and
earn it back over the next 4-5 years.</span>  <span class="s s309">VCs don't want to invest
millions in a company the founders could just walk away from.</span>
<span class="s s310">Financially, vesting has little effect, but in some situations it
could mean founders will have less power.</span>  <span class="s s311">If VCs got de facto
control of the company and fired one of the founders, he'd lose any
unvested stock unless there was specific protection against this.</span>
<span class="s s312">So vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s314">The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is
that the founders will no longer have complete control.</span>  <span class="s s315">Ten years
ago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand the
job over to a business guy they supplied.</span>  <span class="s s316">This is less the rule
now, partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that generic
business guys don't make such great CEOs.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s318">But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO,
they'll have to cede some power, because the board of directors
will become more powerful.</span>  <span class="s s319">In the seed stage, the board is generally
a formality; if you want to talk to the other board members, you
just yell into the next room.</span>  <span class="s s320">This stops with VC-scale money.</span>  <span class="s s321">In
a typical VC funding deal, the board of directors might be composed
of two VCs, two founders, and one outside person acceptable to both.</span>
<span class="s s322">The board will have ultimate power, which means the founders now
have to convince instead of commanding.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s324">This is not as bad as it sounds, however.</span>  <span class="s s325">Bill Gates is in the
same position; he doesn't have majority control of Microsoft; in
principle he also has to convince instead of commanding.</span>  <span class="s s326">And yet
he seems pretty commanding, doesn't he?</span>  <span class="s s327">As long as things are going
smoothly, boards don't interfere much.</span>  <span class="s s328">The danger comes when there's
a bump in the road, as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s330">Like angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through
people they know.</span>  <span class="s s331">So while nearly all VC funds have some address
you can send your business plan to, VCs privately admit the chance
of getting funding by this route is near zero.</span>  <span class="s s332">One recently told
me that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s334">I suspect VCs accept business plans "over the transom" more as a
way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals.</span>  <span class="s s335">In
fact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan
randomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness.</span>
<span class="s s336">Do the extra work of getting personal introductions.</span>  <span class="s s337">As one VC put
it:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s338">I'm not hard to find.</span>  <span class="s s339">I know a lot of people.</span>  <span class="s s340">If you can't find
  some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful
  company?</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s342">
    One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding
when to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because they
rely heavily on first impressions.  And you can't approach some and
save others for later, because (a) they ask who else you've talked
to and when and (b) they talk among themselves.  If you're talking
to one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another several
months ago, you'll definitely seem shopworn.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s343">So when do you approach VCs?</span>  <span class="s s344">When you can convince them.</span>  <span class="s s345">If the
founders have impressive resumes and the idea isn't hard to understand,
you could approach VCs quite early.</span>  <span class="s s346">Whereas if the founders are
unknown and the idea is very novel, you might have to launch the
thing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s348">If several VCs are interested in you, they will sometimes be willing
to split the deal between them.</span>  <span class="s s349">They're more likely to do this if
they're close in the VC pecking order.</span>  <span class="s s350">Such deals may be a net win
for founders, because you get multiple VCs interested in your
success, and you can ask each for advice about the other.</span>  <span class="s s351">One
founder I know wrote:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s352">Two-firm deals are great.</span> <span class="s s353">It costs you a little more equity, but
  being able to play the two firms off each other (as well as ask
  one if the other is being out of line) is invaluable.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s355">
    When you do negotiate with VCs, remember that they've done this a
lot more than you have.  They've invested in dozens of startups,
whereas this is probably the first you've founded.  But don't let
them or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarter
than the average VC.  So just do what you'd do in any complex,
unfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anything
that seems odd.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s356">It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreement
whose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCs
to defend things they do by saying that they're standard in the
industry.</span>  <span class="s s357">Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a few
decades old, and rapidly evolving.</span>  <span class="s s358">The concept of "standard" is a
useful one when you're operating on a small scale (Y Combinator
uses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed-stage
investments it's not worth the overhead of negotiating individual
deals), but it doesn't apply at the VC level.</span>  <span class="s s359">On that scale, every
negotiation is unique.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s361">Most successful startups get money from more than one of the preceding
five sources.</span><span class="s s362">

also tend to be used as the names of different rounds.</span>  <span class="s s363">The best
way to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypothetical
startup.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s365">
    Stage 1: Seed Round
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s366">Our startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea--
either an idea for something they might build, or simply the idea
"let's start a company.</span><span class="s s367">"</span>  <span class="s s368">Presumably they already have some source
of food and shelter.</span>  <span class="s s369">But if you have food and shelter, you probably
also have something you're supposed to be working on: either
classwork, or a job.</span>  <span class="s s370">So if you want to work full-time on a startup,
your money situation will probably change too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s372">A lot of startup founders say they started the company without any
idea of what they planned to do.</span>  <span class="s s373">This is actually less common than
it seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea after quitting
because otherwise their former employer would own it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s375">The three friends decide to take the leap.</span>  <span class="s s376">Since most startups are
in competitive businesses, you not only want to work full-time on
them, but more than full-time.</span>  <span class="s s377">So some or all of the friends quit
their jobs or leave school.</span>  <span class="s s378">(Some of the founders in a startup can
stay in grad school, but at least one has to make the company his
full-time job.</span><span class="s s379">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s380">They're going to run the company out of one of their apartments at
first, and since they don't have any users they don't have to pay
much for infrastructure.</span>  <span class="s s381">Their main expenses are setting up the
company, which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work and
registration fees, and the living expenses of the founders.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s383">The phrase "seed investment" covers a broad range.</span>  <span class="s s384">To some VC firms
it means $500,000, but to most startups it means several months'
living expenses.</span>  <span class="s s385">We'll suppose our group of friends start with
$15,000 from their friend's rich uncle, who they give 5% of the
company in return.</span>  <span class="s s386">There's only common stock at this stage.</span>  <span class="s s387">They
leave 20% as an options pool for later employees (but they set
things up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if they
get bought early and most is still unissued), and the three founders
each get 25%.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s389">By living really cheaply they think they can make the remaining
money last five months.</span>  <span class="s s390">When you have five months' runway left,
how soon do you need to start looking for your next round?</span>  <span class="s s391">Answer:
immediately.</span>  <span class="s s392">It takes time to find investors, and time (always
more than you expect) for the deal to close even after they say
yes.</span>  <span class="s s393">So if our group of founders know what they're doing they'll
start sniffing around for angel investors right away.</span>  <span class="s s394">But of course
their main job is to build version 1 of their software.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s396">The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase,
but being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson.</span>
<span class="s s397">For a startup, cheapness is power.</span>  <span class="s s398">The lower your costs, the more
options you have&acirc;&#128;&#148;not just at this stage, but at every point till
you're profitable.</span>  <span class="s s399">When you have a high "burn rate," you're always
under time pressure, which means (a) you don't have time for your
ideas to evolve, and (b) you're often forced to take deals you don't
like.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s401">
    Every startup's rule should be: spend little, and work fast.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s402">After ten weeks' work the three friends have built a prototype that
gives one a taste of what their product will do.</span>  <span class="s s403">It's not what
they originally set out to do&acirc;&#128;&#148;in the process of writing it, they
had some new ideas.</span>  <span class="s s404">And it only does a fraction of what the finished
product will do, but that fraction includes stuff that no one else
has done before.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s406">They've also written at least a skeleton business plan, addressing
the five fundamental questions: what they're going to do, why users
need it, how large the market is, how they'll make money, and who
the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them.</span>
<span class="s s407">(That last has to be more specific than "they suck" or "we'll work
really hard.</span><span class="s s408">"</span><span class="s s409">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s410">If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or the
business plan, spend most on the demo.</span>   <span class="s s411">Software is not only more
convincing, but a better way to explore ideas.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s413">
    Stage 2: Angel Round
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s414">While writing the prototype, the group has been traversing their
network of friends in search of angel investors.</span>  <span class="s s415">They find some
just as the prototype is demoable.</span>  <span class="s s416">When they demo it, one of the
angels is willing to invest.</span>  <span class="s s417">Now the group is looking for more
money: they want enough to last for a year, and maybe to hire a
couple friends.</span>  <span class="s s418">So they're going to raise $200,000.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s420">The angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million.</span>
<span class="s s421">The company issues $200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; if
there were 1000 shares before the deal, this means 200 additional
shares.</span>  <span class="s s422">The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of the
company, and all the previous shareholders' percentage ownership
is diluted by a sixth.</span>  <span class="s s423">After the deal, the capitalization table
looks like this:</span>
    </p><xmp>
     <span class="s s424">shareholder   shares    percent
-------------------------------
angel           200       16.</span><span class="s s425">7
uncle            50        4.</span><span class="s s426">2
each founder    250       20.</span><span class="s s427">8
option pool     200       16.</span><span class="s s428">7
               ----      -----
total          1200      100</span>
    </xmp><span class="s s429">
    To keep things simple, I had the angel do a straight cash for stock
deal.  In reality the angel might be more likely to make the
investment in the form of a convertible loan.  A convertible loan
is a loan that can be converted into stock later; it works out the
same as a stock purchase in the end, but gives the angel more
protection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s430">Who pays the legal bills for this deal?</span>  <span class="s s431">The startup, remember,
only has a couple thousand left.</span>  <span class="s s432">In practice this turns out to be
a sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way.</span>
<span class="s s433">Maybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the
hope of future work if the startup succeeds.</span>  <span class="s s434">Maybe someone has a
lawyer friend.</span>  <span class="s s435">Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to represent
both sides.</span><span class="s s436">  (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer
is
    <i>
     representing
    </i>
    you rather than merely advising you, or his
only duty is to the investor.</span><span class="s s437">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s438">An angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the board
of directors.</span>  <span class="s s439">He might also want preferred stock, meaning a special
class of stock that has some additional rights over the common stock
everyone else has.</span>  <span class="s s440">Typically these rights include vetoes over major
strategic decisions, protection against being diluted in future
rounds, and the right to get one's investment back first if the
company is sold.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s442">Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a
sum this size, and others wouldn't.</span>  <span class="s s443">VCs are more likely to require
vesting than angels.</span>  <span class="s s444">At Viaweb we managed to raise $2.</span><span class="s s445">5 million
from angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we were
so inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea.</span>  <span class="s s446">In practice
this turned out to be good, because it made us harder to push around.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s448">Our experience was unusual; vesting is the norm for amounts that
size.</span>  <span class="s s449">Y Combinator doesn't require vesting, because (a) we invest
such small amounts, and (b) we think it's unnecessary, and that the
hope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work.</span>
<span class="s s450">But maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s452">I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect
themselves against one another.</span>  <span class="s s453">It solves the problem of what to
do if one of the founders quits.</span>  <span class="s s454">So some founders impose it on
themselves when they start the company.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s456">
    The angel deal takes two weeks to close, so we are now three months
into the life of the company.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s457">The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money will
usually be the happiest phase in a startup's life.</span>  <span class="s s458">It's a lot like
being a postdoc: you have no immediate financial worries, and few
responsibilities.</span>  <span class="s s459">You get to work on juicy kinds of work, like
designing software.</span>  <span class="s s460">You don't have to spend time on bureaucratic
stuff, because you haven't hired any bureaucrats yet.</span>  <span class="s s461">Enjoy it
while it lasts, and get as much done as you can, because you will
never again be so productive.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s463">With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in the
bank, the founders happily set to work turning their prototype into
something they can release.</span>  <span class="s s464">They hire one of their friends&acirc;&#128;&#148;at
first just as a consultant, so they can try him out&acirc;&#128;&#148;and then a
month later as employee #1.</span> <span class="s s465">They pay him the smallest salary he can
live on, plus 3% of the company in restricted stock, vesting over
four years.</span>  <span class="s s466">(So after this the option pool is down to 13.</span><span class="s s467">7%).</span><span class="s s468">

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s470">How much stock do you give early employees?</span>  <span class="s s471">That varies so much
that there's no conventional number.</span>  <span class="s s472">If you get someone really
good, really early, it might be wise to give him as much stock as
the founders.</span>  <span class="s s473">The one universal rule is that the amount of stock
an employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company.</span>
<span class="s s474">In other words, you get rich as a power of how early you were.</span>  <span class="s s475">So
if some friends want you to come work for their startup, don't wait
several months before deciding.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s477">A month later, at the end of month four, our group of founders have
something they can launch.</span>  <span class="s s478">Gradually through word of mouth they
start to get users.</span>  <span class="s s479">Seeing the system in use by real users&acirc;&#128;&#148;people
they don't know&acirc;&#128;&#148;gives them lots of new ideas.</span>  <span class="s s480">Also they find
they now worry obsessively about the status of their server.</span>  <span class="s s481">(How
relaxing founders' lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc.</span><span class="s s482">)</span>

   <p>
    <span class="s s483">By the end of month six, the system is starting to have a solid
core of features, and a small but devoted following.</span>  <span class="s s484">People start
to write about it, and the founders are starting to feel like experts
in their field.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s486">We'll assume that their startup is one that could put millions more
to use.</span>  <span class="s s487">Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing, or build
some kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid salesmen.</span>
<span class="s s488">So they decide to start talking to VCs.</span>  <span class="s s489">They get introductions to
VCs from various sources: their angel investor connects them with
a couple; they meet a few at conferences; a couple VCs call them
after reading about them.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s491">
    Step 3: Series A Round
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s492">Armed with their now somewhat fleshed-out business plan and able
to demo a real, working system, the founders visit the VCs they
have introductions to.</span>  <span class="s s493">They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable.</span>
<span class="s s494">They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to?</span>  <span class="s s495">(VCs
are like high school girls: they're acutely aware of their position
in the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a
function of the interest other VCs show in it.</span><span class="s s496">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s497">One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders
a term sheet.</span>  <span class="s s498">A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms
will be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the details
later.</span>  <span class="s s499">By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn
away other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the
"due diligence" required for the deal.</span>  <span class="s s500">Due diligence is the corporate
equivalent of a background check: the purpose is to uncover any
hidden bombs that might sink the company later, like serious design
flaws in the product, pending lawsuits against the company,
intellectual property issues, and so on.</span>  <span class="s s501">VCs' legal and financial
due diligence is pretty thorough, but the technical due diligence
is generally a joke.</span><span class="s s502">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s503">The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs, and six weeks later
they go ahead with the deal.</span>  <span class="s s504">Here are the terms: a $2 million
investment at a pre-money valuation of $4 million, meaning that
after the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company (2 /
(4 + 2)).</span>  <span class="s s505">The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the option
pool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares.</span>  <span class="s s506">So the total
number of new shares issued is 750, and the cap table becomes:</span>
    </p><xmp>
     <span class="s s507">shareholder   shares    percent

    This picture is unrealistic in several respects.  For example, while
the percentages might end up looking like this, it's unlikely that
the VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares.  In fact, every
bit of the startup's paperwork would probably be replaced, as if
the company were being founded anew.  Also, the money might come
in several tranches, the later ones subject to various 
conditions&acirc;&#128;&#148;though this is apparently more common in deals with lower-tier VCs
(whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups) than with the
top firms.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s515">And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floor

   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s535">Anyone who's been through a startup will find the preceding portrait
to be missing something: disasters.</span>  <span class="s s536">If there's one thing all
startups have in common, it's that something is always going wrong.</span>
<span class="s s537">And nowhere more than in matters of funding.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s539">For example, our hypothetical startup never spent more than half
of one round before securing the next.</span>  <span class="s s540">That's more ideal than
typical.</span>  <span class="s s541">Many startups&acirc;&#128;&#148;even successful ones&acirc;&#128;&#148;come close to
running out of money at some point.</span>  <span class="s s542">Terrible things happen to
startups when they run out of money, because they're designed for
growth, not adversity.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s544">But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I've
described is that they all closed.</span>  <span class="s s545">In the startup world, closing
is not what deals do.</span>  <span class="s s546">What deals do is fall through.</span>  <span class="s s547">If you're
starting a startup you would do well to remember that.</span>  <span class="s s548">Birds fly;
fish swim; deals fall through.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s550">Why?</span>  <span class="s s551">Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is that
you lie to yourself.</span>  <span class="s s552">You want the deal to close, so you start to
believe it will.</span>  <span class="s s553">But even correcting for this, startup deals fall
through alarmingly often&acirc;&#128;&#148;far more often than, say, deals to buy
real estate.</span>  <span class="s s554">The reason is that it's such a risky environment.</span>
<span class="s s555">People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked cases
of buyer's remorse.</span>  <span class="s s556">They don't really grasp the risk they're taking
till the deal's about to close.</span>  <span class="s s557">And then they panic.</span>  <span class="s s558">And not just
inexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s560">So if you're a startup founder wondering why some angel investor
isn't returning your phone calls, you can at least take comfort in
the thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundred
times the size.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s562">The example of a startup's history that I've presented is like a
skeleton&acirc;&#128;&#148;accurate so far as it goes, but needing to be fleshed
out to be a complete picture.</span>  <span class="s s563">To get a complete picture, just add
in every possible disaster.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s565">A frightening prospect?</span>  <span class="s s566">In a way.</span>  <span class="s s567">And yet also in a way encouraging.</span>
<span class="s s568">The very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone.</span><span class="s s569">
People overvalue stability&acirc;&#128;&#148;especially
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html">
     young
    </a>
    people, who ironically need it least.</span>  <span class="s s570">And so in starting a startup,
as in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it gets
you halfway there.</span>  <span class="s s571">On the day of the race, most of the other runners
won't show up.</span>

The aim of such regulations is to protect widows and orphans
from crooked investment schemes; people with a million dollars in
liquid assets are assumed to be able to protect themselves.</span>
<span class="s s575">The unintended consequence is that the investments that generate
the highest returns, like hedge funds, are available only to the
rich.</span>

Investors are often compared to sheep.</span>  <span class="s s585">And they are like sheep,
but that's a rational response to their situation.</span>  <span class="s s586">Sheep act the
way they do for a reason.</span>  <span class="s s587">If all the other sheep head for a certain
field, it's probably good grazing.</span>  <span class="s s588">And when a wolf appears, is he
going to eat a sheep in the middle of the flock, or one near the
edge?</span>

This was partly confidence, and partly simple ignorance.</span>  <span class="s s591">We
didn't know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones.</span>  <span class="s s592">We
thought software was all that mattered.</span>  <span class="s s593">But that turned out to be
the right direction to be naive in: it's much better to overestimate
than underestimate the importance of making a good product.</span>

I've omitted one source: government grants.</span>  <span class="s s596">I don't think
these are even worth thinking about for the average startup.</span>
<span class="s s597">Governments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage
startups, but what they give with one hand they take away with the
other: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the
restrictions on what you can do with the money so burdensome, that
it would be easier to take a job to get the money.</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <!-- Here's an excerpt from an email I got from a German startup
founder:
<blockquote>
I recently got 50k EUR government funding for technological innovation (basically to buy software, computers and so on). I can't hire people 
on that money (except pay myself absolute minimum wage) and the money 
is spread over 18 months and arrives with a delay of 6 months. I can't 
spend money on my accountant, or any non-technology costs (can't buy 
chairs either). To solve my money problems and try to set my mind at 
ease, I have been thinking to do consultancy work for other people.
</blockquote> --><span class="s s599">
        You should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some
kind of social engineering-- e.g. to encourage more startups to be
started in Mississippi.  Free money to start a startup in a place
where few succeed is hardly free.
       </span></p>
       <p>
        <span class="s s600">Some government agencies run venture funding groups, which make
investments rather than giving grants.</span>  <span class="s s601">For example, the CIA runs
a venture fund called In-Q-Tel that is modelled on private sector
funds and apparently generates good returns.</span>  <span class="s s602">They would probably
be worth approaching&acirc;&#128;&#148;if you don't mind taking money from the CIA.</span>

Options have largely been replaced with restricted stock, which
amounts to the same thing.</span>  <span class="s s605">Instead of earning the right to buy
stock, the employee gets the stock up front, and earns the right
not to have to give it back.</span>  <span class="s s606">The shares set aside for this purpose
are still called the "option pool.</span><span class="s s607">"</span>

First-rate technical people do not generally hire themselves
out to do due diligence for VCs.</span>  <span class="s s610">So the most difficult
part for startup founders is often responding politely to the inane
questions of the "expert" they send to look you over.</span>

VCs regularly wipe out angels by issuing arbitrary amounts of
new stock.</span>  <span class="s s613">They seem to have a standard piece of casuistry for
this situation: that the angels are no longer working to help the
company, and so don't deserve to keep their stock.</span>  <span class="s s614">This of course
reflects a willful misunderstanding of what investment means; like
any investor, the angel is being compensated for risks he took
earlier.</span>  <span class="s s615">By a similar logic, one could argue that the VCs should
be deprived of their shares when the company goes public.</span>

One new thing the company might encounter is a
        <i>
         down
round
        </i>
        , or a funding round at valuation lower than the previous
round.</span>  <span class="s s618">Down rounds are bad news; it is generally the common stock
holders who take the hit.</span>  <span class="s s619">Some of the most fearsome provisions in
VC deal terms have to do with down rounds&acirc;&#128;&#148;like "full ratchet
anti-dilution," which is as frightening as it sounds.</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span class="s s621">Founders are tempted to ignore these clauses, because they think
the company will either be a big success or a complete bust.</span>  <span class="s s622">VCs
know otherwise: it's not uncommon for startups to have moments of
adversity before they ultimately succeed.</span>  <span class="s s623">So it's worth negotiating
anti-dilution provisions, even though you don't think you need to,
and VCs will try to make you feel that you're being gratuitously
troublesome.</span>
