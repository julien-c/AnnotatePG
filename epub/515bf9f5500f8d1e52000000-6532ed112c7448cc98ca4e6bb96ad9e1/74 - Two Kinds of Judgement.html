   Two Kinds of Judgement
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">

  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">There are two different ways people judge you.</span>  <span class="s s4">Sometimes judging
you correctly is the end goal.</span>  <span class="s s5">But there's a second much more
common type of judgement where it isn't.</span>  <span class="s s6">We tend to regard all
judgements of us as the first type.</span>  <span class="s s7">We'd probably be happier if
we realized which are and which aren't.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s9">The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end
goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.</span>
<span class="s s10">Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is
to judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process.</span>
<span class="s s11">If you feel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been
treated unfairly.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">Nearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so we
get into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgements
are.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s15">But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where
judging you is only a means to something else.</span>  <span class="s s16">These include college
admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course the
judgements made in dating.</span>  <span class="s s17">This kind of judgement is not really
about you.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s19">Put yourself in the position of someone selecting players for a
national team.</span>  <span class="s s20">Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this is a
game with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players.</span>
<span class="s s21">There will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and
many players who clearly shouldn't.</span>  <span class="s s22">The only place your judgement
makes a difference is in the borderline cases.</span>  <span class="s s23">Suppose you screw
up and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to make
the team, and his place to be taken by the 21st best.</span>  <span class="s s24">You've still
picked a good team.</span>  <span class="s s25">If the players have the usual distribution of
ability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the
20th best.</span>  <span class="s s26">Probably the difference between them will be less than
the measurement error.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">The 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged.</span>  <span class="s s29">But your goal
here wasn't to provide a service estimating people's ability.</span>  <span class="s s30">It
was to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th and 21st
best players is less than the measurement error, you've still done
that optimally.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s32">It's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this
kind of misjudgement.</span>  <span class="s s33">It's not aimed at producing a correct estimate
of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s35">One thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems to
be in a position of power.</span>  <span class="s s36">That makes him seem like a judge.</span>  <span class="s s37">If
you regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a judge,
the expectation of fairness goes away.</span><span class="s s38">  The author of a good novel
wouldn't complain that readers were
   <i>
    unfair
   </i>
   for preferring a
potboiler with a racy cover.</span>  <span class="s s39">Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us
believe that every judgement of us is about us.</span>  <span class="s s42">In fact most aren't.</span>
<span class="s s43">This is a rare case where being less self-centered will make people
more confident.</span>  <span class="s s44">Once you realize how little most people judging
you care about judging you accurately&acirc;&#128;&#148;once you realize that because
of the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least
to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the
most effect&acirc;&#128;&#148;you won't take rejection so personally.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">And curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help you
to get rejected less often.</span>  <span class="s s47">If you think someone judging you will
work hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive.</span>
<span class="s s48">But the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced
by random, extraneous factors&acirc;&#128;&#148;that most people judging you are
more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive 
magistrate&acirc;&#128;&#148;the more you realize you can do things to influence the
outcome.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s50">One good place to apply this principle is in college applications.</span>
<span class="s s51">Most high school students applying to college do it with the usual
child's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority in
that they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing;
self-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees care
enough about them to dig down into their application and figure out
whether they're good or not.</span>  <span class="s s52">These combine to make applicants
passive in applying and hurt when they're rejected.</span>  <span class="s s53">If college
applicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processes
are, they'd make more effort to sell themselves, and take the outcome
less personally.</span>
