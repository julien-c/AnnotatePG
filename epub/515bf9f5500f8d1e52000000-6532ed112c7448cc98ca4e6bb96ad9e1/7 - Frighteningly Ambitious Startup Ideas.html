   Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas

   <p>
    <span class="s s3">One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working
on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup
ideas are.</span>  <span class="s s4">In this essay I'm going to demonstrate
this phenomenon by describing some.</span>  <span class="s s5">Any one of them
could make you a billionaire.</span>  <span class="s s6">That might sound like an attractive
prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may
notice you find yourself shrinking away from them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">Don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness.</span>  <span class="s s9">Arguably it's a sign of
sanity.</span>  <span class="s s10">The biggest startup ideas are terrifying.</span>  <span class="s s11">And not just
because they'd be a lot of work.</span>  <span class="s s12">The biggest ideas seem to threaten
your identity: you wonder if you'd have enough ambition to carry
them through.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s14">
    There's a scene in
    <i>
     Being John Malkovich
    </i>
    where the nerdy hero
encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman.</span>  <span class="s s15">She says to
him:</span>
    </p><blockquote><span class="s s16">
     Here's the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue
  what to do with me.
    </span></blockquote><span class="s s17">
    That's what these ideas say to us.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s18">This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand
about startups.</span><span class="s s19">

              You'd expect big startup ideas to be
attractive, but actually they tend to repel you.</span>  <span class="s s20">And that has a
bunch of consequences.</span>  <span class="s s21">It means these ideas are invisible to most
people who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconscious
filters them out.</span>  <span class="s s22">Even the most ambitious people are probably best
off approaching them obliquely.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s24">
    1. A New Search Engine
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible.</span>  <span class="s s26">I don't
know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be.</span>
<span class="s s27">Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently
I've noticed some cracks in their fortress.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s29">The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their
way was when they decided to get into the search business.</span>  <span class="s s30">That
was not a natural move for Microsoft.</span>  <span class="s s31">They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business.</span>  <span class="s s32">But
this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b)
Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't good at.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s34">
    Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">That does not by itself mean
there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using Google
search I've found myself nostalgic for the old days, when
Google was true to its own slightly aspy self.</span>  <span class="s s36">Google used to give
me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter.</span>  <span class="s s37">Now the
results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's
true is what's true for you.</span>  <span class="s s38">And the pages don't have the
clean, sparse feel they used to.</span>  <span class="s s39">Google search results used to
look like the output of a Unix utility.</span>  <span class="s s40">Now if I accidentally put
the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s42">The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers
use.</span>  <span class="s s43">A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers
and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its
small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine.</span>  <span class="s s44">And
for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems
thinkable to me.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s46">Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000
hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search
engine you yourself want.</span>  <span class="s s47">Feel free to make it excessively hackerish.</span>
<span class="s s48">Make it really good for code search, for example.</span>  <span class="s s49">Would you like
search queries to be Turing complete?</span>  <span class="s s50">Anything that gets you those
10,000 users is ipso facto good.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s52">Don't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the
long term, because if you don't get that initial core of users,
there won't be a long term.</span>  <span class="s s53">If you can just build something that
you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you're already
about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they
probably didn't realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s55">
    2. Replace Email
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now.</span>  <span class="s s57">Email is
not a messaging protocol.</span>  <span class="s s58">It's a todo list.</span>  <span class="s s59">Or rather, my inbox
is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it.</span>  <span class="s s60">But it
is a disastrously bad todo list.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s62">I'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I
suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has
to be replaced with a new protocol.</span> 
<span class="s s63">This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not
a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where
what someone wants you to do is: read the following text.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s65">As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power
to the recipient than email does.</span>  <span class="s s66">I want there to be more restrictions
on what someone can put on my todo list.</span>  <span class="s s67">And when someone can put
something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what
they want from me.</span>  <span class="s s68">Do they want me to do something beyond just
reading some text?</span>  <span class="s s69">How important is it?</span>  <span class="s s70">(There obviously has to
be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is
important.</span><span class="s s71">)  When does it have to be done?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s73">This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting
an immovable object.</span>  <span class="s s74">On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible
to replace.</span>  <span class="s s75">On the other, it seems unlikely that people in
100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now.</span>
<span class="s s76">And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken 
and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerful
people in the world will be among the first to switch to it.</span>  
<span class="s s79">They're all at the mercy of email too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s81">Whatever you build, make it fast.</span>  <span class="s s82">GMail has become painfully slow.</span><span class="s s83">
                                            
                                             [

    </a>
    ]
                                            
                                            If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, that
alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s85">GMail is slow because Google can't afford to spend a lot on it.</span>
<span class="s s86">But people will pay for this.</span>  <span class="s s87">I'd have no problem paying $50 a month.</span>
<span class="s s88">Considering how much time I spend in email, it's kind of scary to
think how much I'd be justified in paying.</span>  <span class="s s89">At least $1000 a month.</span>
<span class="s s90">If I spend several hours a day reading and writing email, that would
be a cheap way to make my life better.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s92">
    3. Replace Universities
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s93">People are all over this idea lately, and I think they're onto
something.</span>  <span class="s s94">I'm reluctant to suggest that an institution that's
been around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakes
they made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last few
decades US universities seem to have been headed down the wrong
path.</span>  <span class="s s95">One could do a lot better for a lot less money.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s97">I don't think universities will disappear.</span>  <span class="s s98">They won't be replaced
wholesale.</span>  <span class="s s99">They'll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain types
of learning that they once had.</span>  <span class="s s100">There will be many different ways
to learn different things, and some may look quite different from
universities.</span>   <span class="s s101">Y Combinator itself is arguably one of them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s103">Learning is such a big problem that changing the way people do it
will have a wave of secondary effects.</span>  <span class="s s104">For example, the name of
the university one went to is treated by a lot of people (correctly
or not) as a credential in its own right.</span>  <span class="s s105">If learning breaks up
into many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it.</span>  <span class="s s106">There
may even need to be replacements for campus social life (and oddly
enough, YC even has aspects of that).</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s108">You could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucratic
obstacles that would slow down a startup.</span>  <span class="s s109">Universities seem the
place to start.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s111">
    4. Internet Drama
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s112">Hollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet.</span>  <span class="s s113">That was a 
mistake, because I think we can now call a winner in the race between
delivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s115">A lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known
as TVs.</span>  <span class="s s116">Our family didn't wait for Apple TV.</span>  <span class="s s117">We hated our last
TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac bolted
to the wall.</span>  <span class="s s118">It's a little inconvenient to control it with a
wireless mouse, but the overall experience is much better than the
nightmare UI we had to deal with before.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s120">Some of the attention people currently devote to watching
movies and TV can be stolen by things that seem completely unrelated,
like social networking apps.</span>  <span class="s s121">More can be stolen by things that are
a little more closely related, like games.</span>  <span class="s s122">But there will probably
always remain some residual demand for conventional drama, where
you sit passively and watch as a plot happens.</span>  <span class="s s123">So how do you deliver
drama via the Internet?</span>  <span class="s s124">Whatever you make will have to be on a
larger scale than Youtube clips.</span>  <span class="s s125">When people sit down to watch a
show, they want to know what they're going to get: either part
of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer "movie"
whose basic premise they know in advance.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s127">There are two ways delivery and payment could play out.</span>  <span class="s s128">Either
some company like Netflix or Apple will be the app store for
entertainment, and you'll reach audiences through them.</span>  <span class="s s129">Or the
would-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technically
inflexible, and companies will arise to supply payment and streaming
a la carte to the producers of drama.</span>  <span class="s s130">If that's the way things
play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s132">
    5. The Next Steve Jobs
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s133">I was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I asked
him if the people now running the company would be able to keep
creating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs.</span>  <span class="s s134">His answer
was simply "no.</span><span class="s s135">"</span>  <span class="s s136">I already feared that would be the answer.</span>  <span class="s s137">I
asked more to see how he'd qualify it.</span>  <span class="s s138">But he didn't qualify it
at all.</span>  <span class="s s139">No, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever's
currently in the pipeline.</span>  <span class="s s140">Apple's
revenues may continue to rise for a long time, but as Microsoft
shows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s142">So if Apple's not going to make the next iPad, who is?</span>  <span class="s s143">None of the
existing players.</span>  <span class="s s144">None of them are run by product visionaries, and
empirically you can't seem to get those by hiring them.</span>  <span class="s s145">Empirically
the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the
company and not get fired.</span>  <span class="s s146">So the company that creates the next
wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s148">I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try
to become as big as Apple.</span>  <span class="s s149">But no more ambitious than it was for
Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it.</span>  <span class="s s150">Plus a startup
taking on this problem now has an advantage the original Apple
didn't: the example of Apple.</span>  <span class="s s151">Steve Jobs has shown us what's
possible.</span>  <span class="s s152">That helps would-be successors both directly, as Roger
Bannister did, by showing how much better you can do than people
did before, and indirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the idea
in users' minds that a single person could unroll the future 
for them.</span><span class="s s153">
                                                                          
                                                                           [
    <a name="f3" href="#f3n">
     3
    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s154">Now Steve is gone there's a vacuum we can all feel.</span>  <span class="s s155">If a new company
led boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow.</span>  <span class="s s156">The
CEO of that company, the "next Steve Jobs," might not measure up
to Steve Jobs.</span> <span class="s s157">But he wouldn't have to.</span>  <span class="s s158">He'd just have to do a
better job than Samsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty
doable.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s160">
    6. Bring Back Moore's Law
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s161">The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore's Law actually says.</span>
<span class="s s162">Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising that
clock speeds would double every 18 months.</span>  <span class="s s163">Actually what it says
is that circuit densities will double every 18 months.</span>  <span class="s s164">It used to
seem pedantic to point that out.</span>  <span class="s s165">Not any more.</span>  <span class="s s166">Intel can no longer
give us faster CPUs, just more of them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s168">This Moore's Law is not as good as the old one.</span>  <span class="s s169">Moore's Law used
to mean that if your software was slow, all you had to do was wait,
and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your problems.
Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do more
things in parallel, which is a lot more work than waiting.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s171">It would be great if a startup could give us something of the old
Moore's Law back, by writing software that could make a large number
of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU.</span>  <span class="s s172">There are
several ways to approach this problem.</span>  <span class="s s173">The most ambitious is to
try to do it automatically: to write a compiler that will parallelize
our code for us.</span><span class="s s174">  There's a name for this compiler,
    <i>
     the sufficiently
smart compiler,
    </i>
    and it is a byword for impossibility.</span>  <span class="s s175">But is
it really impossible?</span>  <span class="s s176">Is there no configuration of the bits in
memory of a present day computer that is this compiler?</span>  <span class="s s177">If you
really think so, you should try to prove it, because that would be
an interesting result.</span>  <span class="s s178">And if it's not impossible but simply very
hard, it might be worth trying to write it.</span>  <span class="s s179">The expected value
would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s181">The reason the expected value is so high is web services.</span>  <span class="s s182">If you
could write software that gave programmers the convenience of the
way things were in the old days, you could offer it to them as a
web service.</span>  <span class="s s183">And that would in turn mean that you got practically
all the users.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s185">Imagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translate
increased circuit densities into increased clock speeds.</span> <span class="s s186">They'd
take most of Intel's business.</span>  <span class="s s187">And since web services mean that
no one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficiently
smart compiler you could create a situation indistinguishable from
you being that manufacturer, at least for the server market.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s189">The least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from
the other end, and offer programmers more parallelizable Lego blocks
to build programs out of, like Hadoop and MapReduce.</span>   <span class="s s190">Then the
programmer still does much of the work of optimization.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s192">There's an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automatic
weapon&acirc;&#128;&#148;where there's a human in the loop.</span>  <span class="s s193">You make something
that looks to the user like the sufficiently smart compiler, but
inside has people, using highly developed optimization tools to
find and eliminate bottlenecks in users' programs.   These people
might be your employees, or you might create a marketplace for
optimization.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s195">An optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficiently
smart compiler piecemeal, because participants would immediately
start writing bots.</span>  <span class="s s196">It would be a curious state of affairs if you
could get to the point where everything could be done by bots,
because then you'd have made the sufficiently smart compiler, but
no one person would have a complete copy of it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s198">I realize how crazy all this sounds.</span>  <span class="s s199">In fact, what I like about
this idea is all the different ways in which it's wrong.</span>  <span class="s s200">The whole
idea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trend
in software development for the last several decades.</span>  <span class="s s201">Trying to
write the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake.</span>
<span class="s s202">And even if it weren't, compilers are the sort of software that's
supposed to be created by open source projects, not companies.</span>  <span class="s s203">Plus
if this works it will deprive all the programmers who take pleasure
in making multithreaded apps of so much amusing complexity.</span> <span class="s s204">The
forum troll I have by now internalized doesn't even know where to
begin in raising objections to this project.</span>  <span class="s s205">Now that's what I
call a startup idea.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s207">
    7. Ongoing Diagnosis
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s208">
    But wait, here's another that could face even greater resistance:
ongoing, automatic medical diagnosis.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s209">One of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine the
ways in which we'll seem backward to future generations.</span>  <span class="s s210">And I'm
pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it will
seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms
to be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s212">For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of
breath.</span>  <span class="s s213">Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over
90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass.</span>  <span class="s s214">It seems
reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available.</span>
<span class="s s215">And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked
to learn that the number was over 90%.</span>  <span class="s s216">Surely at some point in the
future we'll know these numbers the way we now know something like
our weight.</span>  <span class="s s217">Ditto for cancer.</span>  <span class="s s218">It will seem preposterous to future
generations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms to
be diagnosed with cancer.</span>  <span class="s s219">Cancer will show up on some sort of radar
screen immediately.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s221">(Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from
what we think of now as cancer.</span>  <span class="s s222">I wouldn't be surprised if at any
given time we have ten or even hundreds of microcancers going at
once, none of which normally amount to anything.</span><span class="s s223">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s224">A lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the fact
that it's going against the grain of the medical profession.</span>  <span class="s s225">The
way medicine has always worked is that patients come to doctors
with problems, and the doctors figure out what's wrong.</span>  <span class="s s226">A lot of
doctors don't like the idea of going on the medical equivalent of
what lawyers call a "fishing expedition," where you go looking for
problems without knowing what you're looking for.</span>  <span class="s s227">They call the
things that get discovered this way "incidentalomas," and they are
something of a nuisance.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s229">For example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part
of a study.</span>  <span class="s s230">She was horrified when the doctors running the study
discovered what appeared to be a large tumor.</span>  <span class="s s231">After further testing,
it turned out to be a harmless cyst.</span>  <span class="s s232">But it cost her a few days
of terror.</span> <span class="s s233">A lot of doctors worry that if you start scanning people
with no symptoms, you'll get this on a giant scale: a huge number
of false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive and
perhaps even dangerous tests to resolve.</span>  <span class="s s234">But I think that's just
an artifact of current limitations.</span>  <span class="s s235">If people were scanned all the
time and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, my
friend would have known about this cyst her whole life and known
it was harmless, just as we do a birthmark.</span>

    <span class="s s237">There is room for a lot of startups here.</span>  
<span class="s s238">In addition to the technical obstacles all
startups face, and the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startups
face, they'll be going against thousands of years of medical
tradition.</span>  <span class="s s239">But it will happen, and it will be a great thing&acirc;&#128;&#148;so
great that people in the future will feel as sorry for us as we do
for the generations that lived before anaesthesia and antibiotics.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s241">
    Tactics
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s242">Let me conclude with some tactical advice.</span>  <span class="s s243">If you want to take on
a problem as big as the ones I've discussed, don't make a direct
frontal attack on it.</span>  <span class="s s244">Don't say, for example, that you're going
to replace email.</span>  <span class="s s245">If you do that you raise too many expectations.</span>
<span class="s s246">Your employees and investors will constantly be asking "are we there
yet?</span><span class="s s247">"</span> <span class="s s248">and you'll have an army of haters waiting to see you fail.</span>
<span class="s s249">Just say you're building todo-list software.</span>  <span class="s s250">That sounds harmless.</span><span class="s s251">
People can notice you've replaced email when it's a
    <i>
     fait accompli
    </i>
    .</span><span class="s s252">
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                     [

    <span class="s s253">Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start
with deceptively small things.</span>  <span class="s s254">Want to dominate microcomputer
software?</span>  <span class="s s255">Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine with
a few thousand users.</span>  <span class="s s256">Want to make the universal web site?</span>  <span class="s s257">Start
by building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s259">Empirically, it's not just for other people that you need to start
small.</span>  <span class="s s260">You need to for your own sake.</span>  <span class="s s261">Neither Bill Gates nor Mark
Zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get.</span>
<span class="s s262">All they knew was that they were onto something.</span>  <span class="s s263">Maybe it's a bad
idea to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger
your ambition, the longer it's going to take, and the further you
project into the future, the more likely you'll get it wrong.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s265">I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a
precise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get from
here to there, like the popular image of a visionary.</span>  <span class="s s266">You'll be
better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general
westerly direction.</span>  <span class="s s267">Don't try to construct the future like a
building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.</span>
<span class="s s268">Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand
westward.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s270">The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view of
the future, but empirically it may be better to have a blurry one.</span>

It's also one of the most important things VCs fail to
understand about startups.</span>  <span class="s s274">Most expect founders to walk in with a
clear plan for the future, and judge them based on that.</span>  <span class="s s275">Few
consciously realize that in the biggest successes there is the least
correlation between the initial plan and what the startup eventually
becomes.</span>

Roger Bannister is famous as the first person to run a mile
in under 4 minutes.</span>  <span class="s s279">But his world record only lasted 46 days.</span>  <span class="s s280">Once
he showed it could be done, lots of others followed.</span>  <span class="s s281">Ten years

If you want to be the next Apple, maybe you don't even want to start
with consumer electronics.</span>  <span class="s s284">Maybe at first you make something hackers
use.</span>  <span class="s s285">Or you make something popular but apparently unimportant,
like a headset or router.</span>  <span class="s s286">All you need is a bridgehead.</span>
