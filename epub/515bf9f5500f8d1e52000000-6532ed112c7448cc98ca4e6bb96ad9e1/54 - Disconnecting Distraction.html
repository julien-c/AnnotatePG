    Note: The strategy described at the end of this essay didn't work.
It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer.  I'm trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure
they work before writing about them.

  <p>
   <span class="s s4">Procrastination feeds on distractions.</span>  <span class="s s5">Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.</span>
<span class="s s8">But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are
people working hard to distract you.</span>  <span class="s s9">Distraction is not a static
obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.</span>
<span class="s s10">Distraction seeks you out.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s12">Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.</span>  <span class="s s13">Distracting
is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.</span>  <span class="s s14">And technology is
continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.</span>
<span class="s s15">Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,
new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached
the point where it's like visual crack.</span>  <span class="s s18">I realized when I was 13
that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.</span><span class="s s19">  But I read recently
 that the average American watches
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0929/076.html">
    4 hours
   </a>
   of TV a day.</span>  <span class="s s20">A quarter
of their life.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more
addictive ways of wasting time.</span>  <span class="s s23">And what's especially dangerous
is that many happen at your computer.</span>  <span class="s s24">This is no accident.</span>  <span class="s s25">An
ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers
connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward
the procrastinators.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s27">I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for
work.</span>  <span class="s s28">I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp
files, but most of the time I was offline.</span>  <span class="s s29">All I could do was write
and program.</span>  <span class="s s30">Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my
desk.</span>  <span class="s s31">Terribly addictive things are just a click away.</span>  <span class="s s32">Run into
an obstacle in what you're working on?</span>  <span class="s s33">Hmm, I wonder what's new
online.</span>  <span class="s s34">Better check.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s36">After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,
and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because
I didn't realize that it evolves.</span>  <span class="s s37">Something that used to be safe,
using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s38">Some
days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check
email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then
suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real
work done.</span>  <span class="s s39">And this started to happen more and more often.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet
had become, because the problem was intermittent.</span>  <span class="s s42">I ignored it the
way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.</span>  <span class="s s43">When
I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a
problem.</span>  <span class="s s44">It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding
what to do next that they always bit me.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type
of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with
it.</span>  <span class="s s47">If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,
I'd have noticed very quickly.</span>  <span class="s s48">That's a known danger sign, like
drinking alone.</span>  <span class="s s49">But using the Internet still looked and felt a 
lot like work.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much
more distracting that I had to start treating it differently.</span>
<span class="s s52">Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time
sinks: Firefox.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   </p><center><span class="s s54">
    * * *
   </span></center>
  
  <p>
   <span class="s s55">The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need
the Internet for some things.</span>  <span class="s s56">If you drink too much, you can solve
that problem by stopping entirely.</span>  <span class="s s57">But you can't solve the problem
of overeating by stopping eating.</span>  <span class="s s58">I couldn't simply avoid the 
Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s60">At first I tried rules.</span>  <span class="s s61">For example, I'd tell myself I was only
going to use the Internet twice a day.</span>  <span class="s s62">But these schemes never
worked for long.</span>  <span class="s s63">Eventually something would come up that required
me to use it more than that.</span>  <span class="s s64">And then I'd gradually slip back
into my old ways.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s66">Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient
adversaries&mdash;as if there were a little man in your head always
cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're
trying to stop doing.</span>  <span class="s s67">If you leave a path to it, he'll find it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">The key seems to be visibility.</span>  <span class="s s70">The biggest ingredient in most bad habits
is denial.</span><span class="s s71">  So you have to make it so that you can't merely
   <i>
    slip
   </i>
   into doing the thing you're trying to avoid.</span>  <span class="s s72">It has to set off
alarms.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s73">
   Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet
distractions will be
   <a target="_blank" href="http://rescuetime.com">
    software
   </a>
   that watches and controls them.</span>  <span class="s s74">But
in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely
works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s76">I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need
to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop 
on the other side
of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.</span>  <span class="s s77">(Irony of
ironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.</span>  <span class="s s78">When
Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I
bought them for the Y Combinator museum.</span><span class="s s79">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s80">My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long
as I do it on that computer.</span>  <span class="s s81">And this turns out to be enough.</span>  <span class="s s82">When
I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse
the web, I become much more aware of it.</span>  <span class="s s83">Sufficiently aware, in
my case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour
a day online.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s85">And my main computer is now freed for work.</span>  <span class="s s86">If you try this trick,
you'll probably be struck by how different it feels when your
computer is disconnected from the Internet.</span>  <span class="s s87">It was alarming to me
how foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could
only be used for work, because that showed how much time I must
have been wasting.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s89">
   <i>
    Wow.  All I can do at this computer is work.  Ok, I better work
then.
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s90">That's the good part.</span>  <span class="s s91">Your old bad habits now help you to work.</span>
<span class="s s92">You're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a
time.</span>   <span class="s s93">But you can't browse the web or check email now.</span>  <span class="s s94">What are
you going to do?</span>  <span class="s s95">You can't just sit there.</span>  <span class="s s96">So you start working.</span>
