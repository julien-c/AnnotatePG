Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.)

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s4">We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates.</span>  <span class="s s5">Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had
eight startups in it.</span>  <span class="s s6">Of those eight, it now looks as if at least
four succeeded.</span><span class="s s7">  Three have been acquired:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://reddit.com">
     Reddit
    </a>
    was a merger of
two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't
talk about yet.</span><span class="s s8">  Another from that batch was
    <a target="_blank" href="http://loopt.com">
     Loopt
    </a>
    , which is doing
so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if
they wanted to.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s10">So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two
years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.</span>  <span class="s s11">(One thing
you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.</span><span class="s s12">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s13">I'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%.</span>
<span class="s s14">That first batch could have been an anomaly.</span>  <span class="s s15">But we should be able
to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made
up) standard figure of 10%.</span>  <span class="s s16">I'd feel safe aiming at 25%.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s18">Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.</span>  <span class="s s19">Of
those first eight startups, three are now probably dead.</span>  <span class="s s20">In two
cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of
the summer.</span>   <span class="s s21">I don't think they were traumatized by the experience.</span>
<span class="s s22">The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept
working on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by
Google Calendar.</span>  <span class="s s23">But they ended up happy.</span>  <span class="s s24">They sold their software
on eBay for a quarter of a million dollars.</span>  <span class="s s25">After they paid back
their angel investors, they had about a year's salary each.</span><span class="s s26">
                
                 [

    </a>
    ]
                
                Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting
startup,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://justin.tv">
     Justin.TV
    </a>
    .</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch
had a terrible experience.</span>  <span class="s s29">They had ups and downs, like every
startup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a
cubicle.</span>  <span class="s s30">And that statistic is probably not an anomaly.</span>  <span class="s s31">Whatever
our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people
who wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups?</span>  <span class="s s34">If
nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a
significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do
this?</span>  <span class="s s35">A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for
each funding cycle.</span>  <span class="s s36">In fact we usually only get several hundred.</span>
<span class="s s37">Why don't more people apply?</span>  <span class="s s38">And while it must seem to anyone
watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the
number is small compared to the number of people with the necessary
skills.</span>  <span class="s s39">The great majority of programmers still go straight from
college to cubicle, and stay there.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s41">It seems like people are not acting in their own interest.</span>  <span class="s s42">What's
going on?</span>   <span class="s s43">Well, I can answer that.</span>  <span class="s s44">Because of Y Combinator's
position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're
probably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people
who aren't sure if they want to start a company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s46">There's nothing wrong with being unsure.</span>  <span class="s s47">If you're a hacker thinking
about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap,
you're part of a grand tradition.</span>  <span class="s s48">Larry and Sergey seem to have
felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo
before they started Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s49">In fact, I'd guess the most successful
startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than
gung-ho business guys.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s51">We have some evidence to support this.</span>  <span class="s s52">Several of the most successful
startups we've funded told us later that they only decided to apply
at the last moment.</span>  <span class="s s53">Some decided only hours before the deadline.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s55">The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components.</span>
<span class="s s56">Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight
different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know
themselves which are biggest.</span>  <span class="s s57">Some will be justified and some
bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you
don't know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or
mostly bogus.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">So I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to
start startups, and explain which are real.</span>  <span class="s s60">Then would-be founders
can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s62">I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence.</span>  <span class="s s63">But there are
two things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise.</span>
<span class="s s64">One is that I'm motivated to be honest.</span>  <span class="s s65">Most people in the
confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when
you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you
how great you are.</span>  <span class="s s66">Whereas if I encourage people to start startups
who shouldn't, I make my own life worse.</span>  <span class="s s67">If I encourage too many
people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me,
because I have to read all the applications.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s69">The other thing that's going to be different is my approach.</span>  <span class="s s70">Instead
of being positive, I'm going to be negative.</span>  <span class="s s71">Instead of telling
you "come on, you can do it" I'm going to consider all the reasons
you aren't doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be
ignored.</span>  <span class="s s72">We'll start with the one everyone's born with.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s74">
    1. Too young
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s76">Many
are right.</span>  <span class="s s77">The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a
third of the population can truthfully say they're too young.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s79">What's too young?</span>  <span class="s s80">One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover
the lower bound on the age of startup founders.</span>  <span class="s s81">It always seemed
to us that investors were too conservative here&acirc;&#128;&#148;that they wanted
to fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students
or even undergrads.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s83">The main thing we've discovered from pushing the edge of this
envelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.</span>  <span class="s s84">The outer
limit may be as low as 16.</span>  <span class="s s85">We don't look beyond 18 because people
younger than that can't legally enter into contracts.</span>  <span class="s s86">But the most
successful founder we've funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the
time.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s88">Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point.</span>  <span class="s s89">When he was 19,
he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him.</span>  <span class="s s90">There are other
19 year olds who are 12 inside.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">There's a reason we have a distinct word "adult" for people over a
certain age.</span>  <span class="s s93">There is a threshold you cross.</span>  <span class="s s94">It's conventionally
fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages.</span>
<span class="s s95">You're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold,
whatever your age.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s97">How do you tell?</span>  <span class="s s98">There are a couple tests adults use.</span>  <span class="s s99">I realized
these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.</span>  <span class="s s100">I noticed
that I felt like I was talking to someone much older.</span>  <span class="s s101">Afterward I
wondered, what am I even measuring?</span>  <span class="s s102">What made him seem older?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s104">One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.</span>
<span class="s s105">When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you
can cry and say "I can't do it" and the adults will probably let
you off.</span>  <span class="s s106">As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying
"I'm just a kid" that will get you out of most difficult situations.</span>
<span class="s s107">Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.</span>  <span class="s s108">They still
do, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s110">The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge.</span>
<span class="s s111">Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge
from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.</span>  <span class="s s112">If an
adult says "that's a stupid idea," a kid will either crawl away
with his tail between his legs, or rebel.</span>  <span class="s s113">But rebelling presumes
inferiority as much as submission.</span>  <span class="s s114">The adult response to
"that's a stupid idea," is simply to look the other person in the
eye and say "Really?</span>  <span class="s s115">Why do you think so?</span><span class="s s116">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s118">There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges,
of course.</span>  <span class="s s119">What you don't often find are kids who react to challenges
like adults.</span>  <span class="s s120">When you do, you've found an adult, whatever their
age.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s122">
    2. Too inexperienced
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s123">I once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that
people should work for another company for a few years before
starting their own.</span>  <span class="s s124">I no longer believe that, and what changed my
mind is the example of the startups we've funded.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s126">I still think 23 is a better age than 21.</span>  <span class="s s127">But the best way to get
experience if you're 21 is to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s128">So, paradoxically,
if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do
is start one.</span>  <span class="s s129">That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience
than a normal job.</span>  <span class="s s130">In fact, getting a normal job may actually make
you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal
who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to
tell him what software to write.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s132">What really convinced me of this was the Kikos.</span>  <span class="s s133">They started a
startup right out of college.</span>  <span class="s s134">Their inexperience caused them to
make a lot of mistakes.</span>  <span class="s s135">But by the time we funded their second
startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable.</span>  <span class="s s136">They
were certainly not tame animals.</span>  <span class="s s137">And there is no way they'd have
grown so much if they'd spent that year working at Microsoft, or
even Google.</span>  <span class="s s138">They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s140">So now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out
of college.</span>  <span class="s s141">There's no better time to take risks than when you're
young.</span>  <span class="s s142">Sure, you'll probably fail.</span>  <span class="s s143">But even failure will get you
to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s145">It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're
advising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense,
but it's the truth.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s147">
    3. Not determined enough
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s148">
    You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder.
It's probably the single best predictor of success.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s149">Some people may not be determined enough to make it.</span>  <span class="s s150">It's
hard for me to say for sure, because I'm so determined that I can't
imagine what's going on in the heads of people who aren't.</span>  <span class="s s151">But I
know they exist.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s153">Most hackers probably underestimate their determination.</span>  <span class="s s154">I've seen
a lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a 
startup.</span>  <span class="s s155">I can think of
several we've funded who would have been delighted at first to be
bought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s157">How can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey
themselves were unsure at first about starting a company?</span>  <span class="s s158">I'm
guessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're sufficiently
driven to work on your own projects.</span>  <span class="s s159">Though they may have been
unsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as
if Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obediently
doing their advisors' bidding.</span>  <span class="s s160">They started projects of their own.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s162">
    4. Not smart enough
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s163">You may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder.</span>
<span class="s s164">But if you're worried about this, you're probably mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s165">If
you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to
start a startup, you probably are.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s167">And in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much
intelligence.</span>  <span class="s s168">Some startups do.</span>  <span class="s s169">You have to be good at math to
write Mathematica.</span>  <span class="s s170">But most companies do more mundane stuff where
the decisive factor is effort, not brains.</span>  <span class="s s171">Silicon Valley can warp
your perspective on this, because there's a cult of smartness here.</span>
<span class="s s172">People who aren't smart at least try to act that way.</span>  <span class="s s173">But if you
think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a
couple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s175">If you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing
something technically difficult, just write enterprise software.</span>
<span class="s s176">Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're
sales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s178">
    5. Know nothing about business
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s179">This is another variable whose coefficient should be zero.</span>  <span class="s s180">You
don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s181">The
initial focus should be the product.</span>  <span class="s s182">All you need to know in this
phase is how to build things people want.</span>  <span class="s s183">If you succeed, you'll
have to think about how to make money from it.</span>  <span class="s s184">But this is so easy
you can pick it up on the fly.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s186">I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make
something great and not worry too much about making money.</span>  <span class="s s187">And yet
all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of
startups that make something popular manage to make money from it.</span>
<span class="s s188">And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy
startups for, but their strategic value.</span>  <span class="s s189">Which means, because they
made something people want.</span>  <span class="s s190">Acquirers know the rule holds for them
too: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow,
and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't
save you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s192">So why do so many people argue with me?</span>  <span class="s s193">I think one reason is that
they hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get rich
from building something cool that doesn't make any money.</span>  <span class="s s194">They
just don't want that to be possible.</span>  <span class="s s195">But how possible it is doesn't
depend on how much they want it to be.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s197">For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of
irresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers down
the road to ruin.</span>  <span class="s s198">But now I realize this kind of controversy is a
sign of a good idea.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s200">The most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe.</span>
<span class="s s201">They're like undervalued stocks.</span>  <span class="s s202">If you start with them, you'll
have the whole field to yourself.</span>  <span class="s s203">So when you find an idea you
know is good but most people disagree with, you should not
merely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that
direction.</span>  <span class="s s204">In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that
would be popular but seem hard to make money from.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s206">
    We'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we
can't figure out how to make money from.
   </span></p>
   <h3><span class="s s207">
    6. No cofounder
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s208">Not having a cofounder is a real problem.</span>  <span class="s s209">A startup is too much
for one person to bear.</span>  <span class="s s210">And though we differ from other investors
on a lot of questions, we all agree on this.</span>  <span class="s s211">All investors, without
exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s213">We've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested
their first priority should be to find a cofounder.</span>  <span class="s s214">Both did.</span>  <span class="s s215">But
we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied.</span>
<span class="s s216">It's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just
been funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to
sign up for something super hard.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s218">If you don't have a cofounder, what should you do?</span>  <span class="s s219">Get one.</span>  <span class="s s220">It's
more important than anything else.</span>  <span class="s s221">If there's no one where you
live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are
people who do.</span>  <span class="s s222">If no one wants to work with you on your current
idea, switch to an idea people want to work on.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s224">If you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders.</span>
<span class="s s225">A few years out it gets harder to find them.</span>  <span class="s s226">Not only do you have
a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps
even families to support.</span>  <span class="s s227">So if you had friends in college you
used to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well
as you can.</span>  <span class="s s228">That may help keep the dream alive.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s230">It's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a
user's group or a conference.</span>  <span class="s s231">But I wouldn't be too optimistic.</span>
<span class="s s232">You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a
cofounder.</span><span class="s s233">
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                               [
    <a name="f2" href="#f2n">
     2
    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s234">The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder,
but that you should start startups when you're young and there are
lots of them around.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s236">
    7. No idea
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s237">In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because
most startups change their idea anyway.</span>  <span class="s s238">In the average Y Combinator
startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the
first three months.</span>  <span class="s s239">Sometimes it's 100%.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s241">In fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the
initial idea that we're going to try something new this funding
cycle.</span> <span class="s s242">We're going to let people apply with no idea at all.</span>  <span class="s s243">If you
want, you can answer the question on the application form that asks
what you're going to do with "We have no idea.</span><span class="s s244">"</span>  <span class="s s245">If you seem really
good we'll accept you anyway.</span>  <span class="s s246">We're confident we can sit down with
you and cook up some promising project.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s248">Really this just codifies what we do already.</span>  <span class="s s249">We put little weight
on the idea.</span>  <span class="s s250">We ask mainly out of politeness.</span>  <span class="s s251">The kind of question
on the application form that we really care about is the one where
we ask what cool things you've made.</span>  <span class="s s252">If what you've made is version
one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing
we care about is whether you're good at making things.</span>  <span class="s s253">Being lead
developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s255">That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.</span>  <span class="s s256">What
about in the general case?</span>  <span class="s s257">Because in another sense, it is a problem
if you don't have an idea.</span>  <span class="s s258">If you start a startup with no idea,
what do you do next?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s260">So here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.</span>  <span class="s s261">Find something
that's missing in your own life, and supply that need&acirc;&#128;&#148;no matter
how specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer;
who knew so many other people would want them?</span>  <span class="s s262">A need that's narrow
but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but
hypothetical.</span>  <span class="s s263">So even if the problem is simply that you don't have
a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by
writing software, you're onto something, because a lot of other
people have the same problem.</span>

    8. No room for more startups
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s266">A lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and
think "this can't continue.</span><span class="s s267">"</span>  <span class="s s268">Implicit in their thinking is a
fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there
could be.</span>  <span class="s s269">But this is false.</span>  <span class="s s270">No one claims there's any limit on
the number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies.</span>
<span class="s s271">Why should there be any limit on the number who can work for equity
at 5-person companies?</span><span class="s s272">
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                 [

   <p>
    <span class="s s273">Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need.</span>  <span class="s s274">Breaking
up companies into smaller units doesn't make those needs go away.</span>
<span class="s s275">Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a
network of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations,
but I don't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying
current needs would lead to more.</span>  <span class="s s276">Certainly this tends to be the
case in individuals.</span>  <span class="s s277">Nor is there anything wrong with that.</span>  <span class="s s278">We
take for granted things that medieval kings would have considered
effeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperatures
year round.</span>  <span class="s s279">And if things go well, our descendants will take for
granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious.</span>  <span class="s s280">There is
no absolute standard for material wealth.</span>  <span class="s s281">Health care is a component
of it, and that alone is a black hole.</span>  <span class="s s282">For the foreseeable future,
people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit
to the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in
particular.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s284">Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly.</span>  <span class="s s285">Usually
it's implicit in statements like "there are only so many startups
Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy.</span><span class="s s286">"</span>  <span class="s s287">Maybe, though the list of
acquirers is a lot longer than that.</span>  <span class="s s288">And whatever you think of
other acquirers, Google is not stupid.</span>  <span class="s s289">The reason big companies
buy startups is that they've created something valuable.</span>  <span class="s s290">And why
should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies
can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth
individual people want?</span>  <span class="s s291">Maybe there would be practical limits on
the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if
there is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders are
willing to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will
evolve to consume it.</span>  <span class="s s292">Markets are pretty smart that way.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s294">
    9. Family to support
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s295">This one is real.</span>  <span class="s s296">I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start
a startup.</span>  <span class="s s297">I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want
to take responsibility for advising it.</span>  <span class="s s298">I'm willing to take
responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups.</span>  <span class="s s299">So what
if they fail?</span>  <span class="s s300">They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will
still be waiting for them if they need it.</span>  <span class="s s301">But I'm not prepared
to cross moms.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s302">What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup,
is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a
product business.</span>  <span class="s s303">Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem
very small.</span> <span class="s s304">You're never going to produce Google this way.</span>  <span class="s s305">But at
least you'll never be without an income.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s307">Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup
instead of starting your own.</span>  <span class="s s308">Being one of the first employees of
a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and
the bad.</span>  <span class="s s309">You'll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee
number.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s311">
    As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start
startups when you're young.

   <h3><span class="s s312">
    10. Independently wealthy
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s313">This is my excuse for not starting a startup.</span>  <span class="s s314">Startups are stressful.</span>
<span class="s s315">Why do it if you don't need the money?</span>  <span class="s s316">For every "serial entrepreneur,"
there are probably twenty sane ones who think "Start another
company?</span>  <span class="s s317">Are you crazy?</span><span class="s s318">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s320">I've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I
always pull back because I don't want four years of my life to be
consumed by random schleps.</span>  <span class="s s321">I know this business well enough to
know you can't do it half-heartedly.</span>  <span class="s s322">What makes a good startup
founder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s324">There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though.</span>  <span class="s s325">Like a lot
of people, I like to work.</span>  <span class="s s326">And one of the many weird little problems
you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting
people you'd like to work with are not rich.</span>  <span class="s s327">They need to work at
something that pays the bills.</span>  <span class="s s328">Which means if you want to have
them as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays the
bills too, even though you don't need to.</span>  <span class="s s329">I think this is what
drives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s331">
    That's why I love working on Y Combinator so much.  It's an excuse
to work on something interesting with people I like.
   </span></p>
   <h3><span class="s s332">
    11.  Not ready for commitment
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s333">This was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties.</span>
<span class="s s334">Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all.</span>  <span class="s s335">I was
reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a
few months.</span>  <span class="s s336">Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely
took over my life the way a startup does.</span>  <span class="s s337">And that's fine.</span>  <span class="s s338">If you
want to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band,
or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a
company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s340">If you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least
three or four years.</span>  <span class="s s341">(If it fails, you'll be done a lot quicker.</span><span class="s s342">)
So you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that
scale.</span>  <span class="s s343">Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll
probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take,
and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.</span>
<span class="s s344">So if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation
session, you may also be ready to start that startup.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s346">
    12.  Need for structure
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s347">I'm told there are people who need structure in their lives.</span>  <span class="s s348">This
seems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell them
what to do.</span>  <span class="s s349">I believe such people exist.</span>  <span class="s s350">There's plenty of empirical
evidence: armies, religious cults, and so on.</span>  <span class="s s351">They may even be the
majority.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s353">If you're one of these people, you probably shouldn't start a
startup.</span>  <span class="s s354">In fact, you probably shouldn't even go to work for one.</span>
<span class="s s355">In a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much.</span>  <span class="s s356">There
may be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has
about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do.</span>
<span class="s s357">That's too inefficient.</span>  <span class="s s358">Each person should just do what they need
to without anyone telling them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s360">If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team.</span>
<span class="s s361">Eleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways,
and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else
what to do.</span>  <span class="s s362">A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were any
language problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about
eight different countries.</span>  <span class="s s363">He said it was never an issue, because
everyone was so good they never had to talk.</span>  <span class="s s364">They all just did the
right thing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s366">How do you tell if you're independent-minded enough to start a
startup?</span>  <span class="s s367">If you'd bristle at the suggestion that you aren't, then
you probably are.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s369">
    13. Fear of uncertainty
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s370">Perhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because
they don't like the uncertainty.</span>  <span class="s s371">If you go to work for Microsoft,
you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be
like&acirc;&#128;&#148;all too accurately, in fact.</span>  <span class="s s372">If you start a startup, anything
might happen.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s374">Well, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem
for you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail.</span>  <span class="s s375">Seriously, 
though, this is not a bad way to think
about the whole experience.</span>  <span class="s s376">Hope for the best, but expect the
worst.</span>  <span class="s s377">In the worst case, it will at least be interesting.</span>  <span class="s s378">In the
best case you might get rich.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s380">No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a
serious effort.</span>  <span class="s s381">There may once have been a time when employers
would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now.</span>  <span class="s s382">I
asked managers at big companies, and they all said they'd prefer
to hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over
someone who'd spent the same time working at a big company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s384">Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn't fail
out of laziness or incurable stupidity.</span>   <span class="s s385">I'm told there's a lot
of stigma attached to failing in other places&acirc;&#128;&#148;in Europe, for
example.</span>  <span class="s s386">Not here.</span>  <span class="s s387">In America, companies, like practically
everything else, are disposable.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s389">
    14. Don't realize what you're avoiding
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s390">One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two
make better founders than people straight from college is that they
know what they're avoiding.</span>  <span class="s s391">If their startup fails, they'll have
to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s393">If you've had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what
jobs are like, but you probably don't.</span>  <span class="s s394">Summer jobs at technology
companies are not real jobs.</span>  <span class="s s395">If you get a summer job as a waiter,
that's a real job.</span>  <span class="s s396">Then you have to carry your weight.</span>  <span class="s s397">But software
companies don't hire students for the summer as a source of cheap
labor.</span>  <span class="s s398">They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate.</span>
<span class="s s399">So while they're happy if you produce, they don't expect you to.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s401">That will change if you get a real job after you graduate.</span>  <span class="s s402">Then
you'll have to earn your keep.</span>  <span class="s s403">And since most of what big companies
do is boring, you're going to have to work on boring stuff.</span>  <span class="s s404">Easy,
compared to college, but boring.</span>  <span class="s s405">At first it may seem cool to get
paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college.</span>
<span class="s s406">But that wears off after a few months.</span>  <span class="s s407">Eventually it gets demoralizing
to work on dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s409">And that's not the worst of it.</span>  <span class="s s410">The thing that really sucks about
having a regular job is the expectation that you're supposed to be
there at certain times.</span>  <span class="s s411">Even Google is afflicted with this,
apparently.</span>  <span class="s s412">And what this means, as everyone who's had a regular
job can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have
absolutely no desire to work on anything, and you're going to have
to go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend
to.</span>  <span class="s s413">To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this is
torture.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s415">In a startup, you skip all that.</span>  <span class="s s416">There's no concept of office hours
in most startups.</span>  <span class="s s417">Work and life just get mixed together.</span>  <span class="s s418">But the
good thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at
work.</span>  <span class="s s419">In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time.</span>
<span class="s s420">If you're a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work.</span>
<span class="s s421">But you never have to pretend to.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s423">If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem
unprofessional.</span>  <span class="s s424">But if you're starting a startup and you fall
asleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume
you were tired.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s426">
    15. Parents want you to be a doctor
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s427">A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably
dissuaded from doing it by their parents.</span>  <span class="s s428">I'm not going to say you
shouldn't listen to them.</span>  <span class="s s429">Families are entitled to their own
traditions, and who am I to argue with them?</span>  <span class="s s430">But I will give you
a couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents
really want for you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s432">One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids
than they would be for themselves.</span>  <span class="s s433">This is actually a rational
response to their situation.</span>  <span class="s s434">Parents end up sharing more of their
kids' ill fortune than good fortune.</span>  <span class="s s435">Most parents don't mind this;
it's part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively
conservative.</span>  <span class="s s436">And erring on the side of conservatism is still
erring.</span>  <span class="s s437">In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk.</span>  <span class="s s438">So
by protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizing
it, also protecting them from rewards.</span>  <span class="s s439">If they saw that, they'd
want you to take more risks.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s441">The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals,
they're always fighting the last war.</span>  <span class="s s442">If they want you to be a
doctor, odds are it's not just because they want you to help the
sick, but also because it's a prestigious and lucrative career.</span><span class="s s443">

opinions were formed.</span><span class="s s444">  When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctor
was

doctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis.</span>  <span class="s s446">All three vertices now seem
pretty dated.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s448">The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how
much things have changed.</span>  <span class="s s449">Would they be that unhappy if you were
Steve Jobs instead?</span>  <span class="s s450">So I think the way to deal with your parents'
opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature
requests.</span>  <span class="s s451">Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do
that is not simply to give them what they ask for.</span>  <span class="s s452">Instead think
about why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better
way to give them what they need.</span>

    16.  A job is the default
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s455">This leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people
get regular jobs: it's the default thing to do.</span>  <span class="s s456">Defaults are
enormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any
conscious choice.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s458">To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you
need money, you should get a job.</span>  <span class="s s459">Actually this tradition is not
much more than a hundred years old.</span>  <span class="s s460">Before that, the default way
to make a living was by farming.</span>  <span class="s s461">It's a bad plan to treat something
only a hundred years old as an axiom.</span>  <span class="s s462">By historical standards,
that's something that's changing pretty rapidly.</span>

   <p>
    <span class="s s464">We may be seeing another such change right now.</span>  <span class="s s465">I've read a lot
of economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well,
and it now seems to me fairly likely that we're seeing the beginning
of a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s467">And you know what?</span>  <span class="s s468">If you'd been around when that change began
(around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyone
that running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing
to do.</span>  <span class="s s469">Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave their
manors, it can't have been that hard to run away to a city.</span>  <span class="s s470">There
were no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village.</span>  <span class="s s471">What
prevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky.</span>
<span class="s s472">Leave one's plot of land?</span>  <span class="s s473">Leave the people you'd spent your whole
life with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete
strangers?</span>  <span class="s s474">How would you live?</span>  <span class="s s475">How would you get food, if you
didn't grow it?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s477">Frightening as it seemed to them, it's now the default with us to
live by our wits.</span>  <span class="s s478">So if it seems risky to you to start a startup,
think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do
now.</span>  <span class="s s479">Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones
trying to get you to stick to the old model.</span>  <span class="s s480">How can Larry and
Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't
get jobs themselves?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s482">Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it.</span>
<span class="s s483">How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life
with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests
you had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters.</span>
<span class="s s484">I wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we
consider a normal job in the same way.</span>  <span class="s s485">How grim it would be to
commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and
be told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss&acirc;&#128;&#148;someone 
who could call you into their office and say "take a seat,"
and you'd sit!</span><span class="s s486">  Imagine having to ask
    <i>
     permission
    </i>
    to release
software to users.</span>  <span class="s s487">Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because
the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and
go to work.</span>  <span class="s s488">How did they stand it?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s490">It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like
the one from farming to manufacturing.</span>  <span class="s s491">That's why I care about
startups.</span>  <span class="s s492">Startups aren't interesting just because they're a way
to make a lot of money.</span>  <span class="s s493">I couldn't care less about other ways to
do that, like speculating in securities.</span>  <span class="s s494">At most those are interesting
the way puzzles are.</span>  <span class="s s495">There's more going on with startups.</span><span class="s s496">  They
may represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">
     wealth
    </a>
    is created.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s498">That's ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator.</span>  <span class="s s499">We want
to make money, if only so we don't have to stop doing it, but that's
not the main goal.</span>  <span class="s s500">There have only been a handful of these great
economic shifts in human history.</span>  <span class="s s501">It would be an amazing hack to
make one happen faster.</span>

The only people who lost were us.</span>  <span class="s s505">The angels had convertible

The best kind of organization for that might be an open source
project, but those don't involve a lot of face to face meetings.</span>

There need to be some number of big companies to acquire the
startups, so the number of big companies couldn't decrease to zero.</span>

Thought experiment: If doctors did the same work, but as
impoverished outcasts, which parents would still want their kids
to be doctors?</span>
