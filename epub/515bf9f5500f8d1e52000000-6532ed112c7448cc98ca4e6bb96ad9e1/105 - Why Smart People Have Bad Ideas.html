   Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas

    April 2005
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s3">
    This summer, as an 
experiment, some 
friends and I are giving
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">
     seed
funding
    </a>
    to a bunch of new startups.</span>  <span class="s s4">It's an experiment because
we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would.</span>
<span class="s s5">That's why we're doing it during the summer-- so even college
students can participate.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s7">We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful
startups.</span>  <span class="s s8">And we know from experience that some undergrads are as
capable as most grad students.</span>  <span class="s s9">The accepted age for startup founders
has been creeping downward.</span> <span class="s s10">We're trying to find the lower bound.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- There have been cases, certainly, of startups founded by people
still in their teens.  But I suspect few of them were allowed
by investors to be more than mascots.That's not how we plan to operate.  Having done it once, we have
no desire to experience again the 24/7 timesuck of running even one
startup, let alone eight or ten.  We'll give these guys as much
help as we can with their ideas, but it will be up to them to sink
or swim.
--><span class="s s12">
    The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications.
    </span><!--We've learned a few surprising things in the process.
One pleasant surprise is how few cranks we got.  We expected to
attract flocks of them, but we've only had a handful.  We were
surprised, too, at how smart the applicants appear to be.  And how
extraordinarily energetic.  But you know what the most surprising
thing is?  How bad some of the smartest applicants' ideas are.--><span class="s s13">
    We expected to divide them into two categories, promising
and unpromising.  But we soon saw we needed a third: promising
people with unpromising ideas.

   <h3><span class="s s16">
    The Artix Phase
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s17">We should have expected this.</span>  <span class="s s18">It's very common for a group of
founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup
has to make something people will pay for.</span>   <span class="s s19">In fact, we ourselves
did.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started.</span>  <span class="s s22">In
January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called
Artix.</span>  <span class="s s23">The plan was to put art galleries on the Web.</span>  <span class="s s24">In retrospect,
I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid.</span><span class="s s25">
Galleries are not especially
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knoedlergallery.com/">
     excited
    </a>
    about being on
the Web even now, ten years later.</span>  <span class="s s26">They don't want to have their
stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store.</span><span class="s s27">
                  
                   [

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on
earth.</span>  <span class="s s29">They didn't become art dealers after a difficult choice
between that and a career in the hard sciences.</span>  <span class="s s30">Most of them had
never seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be
on it.</span>  <span class="s s31">Some didn't even have computers.</span><span class="s s32">  It doesn't do justice to
the situation to describe it as a hard
    <i>
     sell
    </i>
    ; we soon sank
to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries
even to do that.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s34">Gradually it dawned on us that 
instead of trying to make Web sites for
people who didn't want them, we could make sites for
people who did.</span>  <span class="s s35">In fact, software that would let people who wanted
sites make their own.</span>  <span class="s s36">So we ditched Artix and
started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores.</span>
<span class="s s37">That one succeeded.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s39">
    We're in good company here.  Microsoft was not the first company
Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either.  The first was called
Traf-o-data.
    </span><!-- I don't know exactly what happened to Traf-o-data,  
but i--><span class="s s40">
    It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft.
    </span><!-- , as Microsoft was called then.-->
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s41">In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix.</span>  <span class="s s42">I dragged him
into it.</span><span class="s s43">
                          
                           [

                          But there were moments when he was optimistic.</span>  <span class="s s44">And
if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such
a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers
aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s46">
    The Still Life Effect
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s47">
    Why does this happen?  Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s48">Let's look at our case.</span>  <span class="s s49">One reason we had such a lame idea was
that it was the first thing we thought of.</span>  <span class="s s50">I was in New York trying
to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually
quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway.</span>  <span class="s s51">When I learned
about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two.</span>  <span class="s s52">Make Web sites
for galleries-- that's the ticket!</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think
it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different
ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head.</span>
<span class="s s55">You'd think.</span>  <span class="s s56">But people don't.</span>  <span class="s s57">In fact, this is a constant problem
when you're painting still lifes.</span>  <span class="s s58">You plonk down a bunch of stuff
on a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to 
look interesting.</span>  <span class="s s59">But you're so impatient to get started painting
that ten minutes of rearranging feels very long.</span>  <span class="s s60">So you start
painting.</span>  <span class="s s61">Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at
it, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and   
boring composition, but by then it's too late.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s63">Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small
ones.</span>  <span class="s s64">You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have
a spare hour, and days later you're still working on it.</span>  <span class="s s65">I once
spent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in
about four minutes.</span>  <span class="s s66">At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought
I'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s68">
    So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect:  you 
come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point
(a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that
this must be
    <i>
     the
    </i>
    idea.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s70">How do we fix that?</span>  <span class="s s71">I don't think we should discard plunging.</span>   
<span class="s s72">Plunging into an idea is a good thing.</span>  <span class="s s73">The solution is at the other
end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make
it good.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">This is clearest in the case of names.</span>  <span class="s s76">Viaweb was originally
called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called
that.</span><span class="s s77">  We were so attached to our name that we offered him
    <i>
     5%
of the company
    </i>
    if he'd let us have it.</span>   <span class="s s78">But he wouldn't, so
we had to think of another.</span><span class="s s79">
                                          
                                           [
    <a href="#f4n" name="f4">
     4
    </a>
    ]
                                          
                                          The best we could do was Viaweb,
which we disliked at first.</span>  <span class="s s80">It was like having a new mother.</span>  <span class="s s81">But 
within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and
old-fashioned.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s83">If it's hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine
how hard it is to garbage-collect an idea.</span>  <span class="s s84">A name only has one 
point of attachment into your head.</span>  <span class="s s85">An idea for a company gets
woven into your thoughts.</span>  <span class="s s86">So you must consciously discount for   
that.</span>  <span class="s s87">Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your   
idea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something people
will pay for?</span>  <span class="s s88">Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing
people will pay most for?</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s90">
    Muck
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s91">
    The second mistake we made with Artix is also very common.  Putting
galleries on the Web seemed cool.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old
Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass.</span>  <span class="s s93">Meaning that 
unpleasant work pays.</span>  <span class="s s94">And more to the point here, vice versa.</span>  <span class="s s95">Work
people like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand.</span>
<span class="s s96">The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which
doesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for 
free.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s98">When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business.</span>  <span class="s s99">I
wanted to keep one foot in the art world.</span>  <span class="s s100">Big, big, mistake.</span>  <span class="s s101">Going
into business is like a hang-glider launch-- you'd better do it 
wholeheartedly, or not at all.</span>  <span class="s s102">The purpose of a company, and a
startup especially, is to make money.</span>  <span class="s s103">You can't have divided
loyalties.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort  
of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose  
is patent litigation.</span>  <span class="s s106">What I mean is, if you're starting a company
that will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money 
and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s108">
    It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident.
Unless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to happen at all.
   </span></p>
   <h3><span class="s s109">
    Hyenas
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s110">When I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity.</span>
<span class="s s111">If you'd proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business,
we'd have found the idea terrifying.</span>  <span class="s s112">Surely a field like that would
be dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VC
money each.</span>  <span class="s s113">Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own
in the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites 
for art galleries.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s115">We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety.</span>  <span class="s s116">As it turns out,
VC-backed startups are not that fearsome.</span><span class="s s117">  They're too busy trying
to spend all that
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html">
     money
    </a>
    to get software written.</span>  <span class="s s118">In 1995, the
e-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press
releases, but not as measured in software.</span>  <span class="s s119">And really it never
was.</span><span class="s s120">  The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just
consulting companies pretending to be product companies
                                                              
                                                               [
    <a href="#f5n" name="f5">

    </a>
    ]
                                                              
                                                              , and  
the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines
of Perl scripts.</span>  <span class="s s121">Or could have been implemented as a couple hundred
lines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines
of C++ or Java.</span>  <span class="s s122">Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce,
it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s124">So why were we afraid?</span>  <span class="s s125">We felt we were good at programming, but
we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated
thing we called "business.</span><span class="s s126">"</span>  <span class="s s127">In fact there is no such thing as
"business.</span><span class="s s128">"</span> <span class="s s129">There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people
want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your
bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising
money, and so on.</span>  <span class="s s130">And the combination is not as hard as it seems,   
because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated)
are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others
(like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination
than any kind of special training.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s132">Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we
were afraid of the lions.</span>  <span class="s s133">Except the lions turned out not to have 
any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely
qualified as carrion.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s135">
    A Familiar Problem
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s136">Sum up all these sources of error, and it's no wonder we had such
a bad idea for a company.</span>  <span class="s s137">We did the first thing we thought of;
we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately
chose an impoverished market to avoid competition.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s139">Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see
signs of all three.</span>  <span class="s s140">But the first is by far the biggest problem.</span><span class="s s141">  
Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the 
things we could do, is
    <i>
     this
    </i>
    the one with the best chance of
making money?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s143">If they'd already been through their Artix phase, they'd have learned
to ask that.</span>  <span class="s s144">After the reception we got from art dealers, we were
ready to.</span>  <span class="s s145">This time, we thought, let's make something people want.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s147">
    Reading the
    <i>
     Wall Street Journal
    </i>
    for a week should give anyone
ideas for two or three new startups.</span>  <span class="s s148">The articles are full of
descriptions of problems that need to be solved.</span>  <span class="s s149">But most of the
applicants don't seem to have looked far for ideas.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s151">We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games.</span>
<span class="s s152">We were not far off: this was the second most common.</span> 
<span class="s s153">The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar,
a dating site, and Friendster.</span>  <span class="s s154">Maybe there is some new killer app
to be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around
in this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying about
in the open for anyone to see.</span>  <span class="s s155">Why did no one propose a new scheme   
for micropayments?</span>  <span class="s s156">An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can't    
believe we've considered every alternative.</span>  <span class="s s157">And newspapers and
magazines are (literally) dying for a solution.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s159">
    Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want?
I think the problem with many, as with people in their early twenties
generally, is that they've been trained their whole lives to jump
through predefined hoops.  They've spent 15-20 years solving problems
other people have set for them.  And how much time deciding what  
problems would be good to solve?  Two or three course projects?
    </span><!-- Robert is one of us trying to rank the applications.  He's a professor
now, and he said recently that reading the proposals felt awfully 
familiar.  --><span class="s s160">
    They're good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s161">But that, I'm convinced, is just the effect of training.</span>  <span class="s s162">Or more
precisely, the effect of grading.</span>  <span class="s s163">To make grading efficient,
everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to
be decided in advance.</span>  <span class="s s164">It would be great if schools taught students
how to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don't
know how you'd run such a class in practice.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s166">
    Copper and Tin
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s167">The good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned.</span>

customers want.</span><span class="s s170">

   <p>
    <span class="s s171">This is a controversial view.</span>  <span class="s s172">One expert on "entrepreneurship"
told me that any startup had to include business people, because
only they could focus on what customers wanted.</span>  <span class="s s173">I'll probably
alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it,
because his email was such a perfect example of this view:</span>
    </p><blockquote><span class="s s174">
     80% of MIT spinoffs succeed
     <i>
      provided
     </i>
     they 
  have at least one management person in the team at the start.</span> <span class="s s175">The   
  business person represents the "voice of the customer" and that's
  what keeps the engineers and product development on track.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s177">
    This is, in my opinion, a crock.  Hackers are perfectly capable of
hearing the voice of the customer without a business person to
amplify the signal for them.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad
students in computer science, which presumably makes them "engineers."
Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business
guy whispering in their ears what customers wanted?   It seems to 
me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who 
obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting
started.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s178">The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring 
out that you need to figure it out.</span>  <span class="s s179">But that's something you can
learn quickly.</span>  <span class="s s180">It's like seeing the other interpretation of an
ambiguous picture.</span>  <span class="s s181">As soon as someone tells you there's a rabbit
as well as a duck, it's hard not to see it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s183">And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving,
giving customers what they want is easy.</span><span class="s s184">  Anyone who can write an 
optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn't confuse users, 
once they
    <i>
     choose
    </i>
    to focus on that problem.</span>  <span class="s s185">And once you   
apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions,     
you can create wealth very rapidly.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s187">That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work
that's beneath them.</span>   <span class="s s188">Big companies try to hire the right person
for the job.</span>  <span class="s s189">Startups win because they don't-- because they take
people so smart that they would in a big company be doing "research,"

they're showing him is something special that only a few people

Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup:
