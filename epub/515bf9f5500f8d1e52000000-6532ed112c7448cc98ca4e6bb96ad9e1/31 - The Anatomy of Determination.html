   The Anatomy of Determination

   <p>
    <span class="s s3">Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to
predict which startups will succeed.</span>  <span class="s s4">We probably spend more time
thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.</span>
<span class="s s5">Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s7">We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is
determination.</span>  <span class="s s8">At first we thought it might be intelligence.</span>
<span class="s s9">Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed.</span>  <span class="s s10">It
makes a better story that a company won because its founders were
so smart.</span>  <span class="s s11">The PR people and reporters who spread such stories
probably believe them themselves.</span>  <span class="s s12">But while it certainly helps to
be smart, it's not the deciding factor.</span>  <span class="s s13">There are plenty of people
as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination&mdash;partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s17">I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but
the relative importance of determination and talent probably do
vary somewhat.</span>  <span class="s s18">Talent probably matters more in types of work that
are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type
of problem instead of many different types.</span>   <span class="s s19">I suspect determination
would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized
crime.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that
depend more on talent are always more admirable.</span>  <span class="s s22">Most people would
agree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long
strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural
ability.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s24">Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being
smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups
than it used to in earlier types of companies.</span>  <span class="s s25">You probably do
need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had
to be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers.</span>  <span class="s s26">And that's
probably an ongoing trend.</span>  <span class="s s27">But even in the highest of high tech
industries, success still depends more on determination than brains.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s29">If determination is so important, can we isolate its components?</span>
<span class="s s30">Are some more important than others?</span>  <span class="s s31">Are there some you can
cultivate?</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s33">
    The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness.  When you
want something, you must have it, no matter what.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s34">A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to
see families where one sibling has much more of it than another.</span>
<span class="s s35">Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature
seems to be more important than nurture.</span>  <span class="s s36">Bad circumstances can
break the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's
much you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s38">Being strong-willed is not enough, however.</span>  <span class="s s39">You also have to be
hard on yourself.</span>  <span class="s s40">Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent
would not be called determined.</span>  <span class="s s41">Determination implies your willfulness
is balanced by discipline.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s43">That word balance is a significant one.</span>  <span class="s s44">The more willful you are,
the more disciplined you have to be.</span>  <span class="s s45">The stronger your will, the
less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself.</span>  <span class="s s46">And
someone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses,
and if you have more will than discipline you'll just give into
them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s48">We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a
slippery melon seed.</span>  <span class="s s49">The harder they squeeze, the further the seed
flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off
sideways.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s51">If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline
can be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the
course of an individual's life.</span>  <span class="s s52">If determination is effectively
the product of will and discipline, then you can become more
determined by being more disciplined.</span><span class="s s53">

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful
you are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined.</span>  <span class="s s55">There seem
to be plenty of examples to confirm that.</span>  <span class="s s56">In some very energetic
people's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they
alternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing.</span>
<span class="s s57">Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however:
it's static.</span>  <span class="s s60">In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with
temptation.</span>  <span class="s s61">Which means, interestingly, that determination tends
to erode itself.</span>  <span class="s s62">If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great
things, this will probably increase the number of temptations around
you.</span>  <span class="s s63">Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness
will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to
the mean.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s65">
    That's why Julius Caesar thought thin men so dangerous.  They weren't
tempted by the minor perquisites of power.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s66">The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined.</span>
<span class="s s67">Is it?</span>  <span class="s s68">I think there probably are people whose willfulness is
crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more
if they weren't so hard on themselves.</span>  <span class="s s69">One reason the young sometimes
succeed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent
they are.</span>  <span class="s s70">This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.</span>  <span class="s s71">When they
first start working on something, they overrate their achievements.</span>
<span class="s s72">But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance
improves.</span>  <span class="s s73">Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial
incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from
continuing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">There's one other major component of determination: ambition.</span>  <span class="s s76">If
willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,
ambition is how you choose it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component
of determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal.</span>  <span class="s s79">It would
seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do
something trivially easy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s81">And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lot
you can do to increase it.</span>  <span class="s s82">Most people don't know how ambitious
to be, especially when they're young.</span>  <span class="s s83">They don't know what's hard,
or what they're capable of.</span>  <span class="s s84">And this problem is exacerbated by
having few peers.</span>  <span class="s s85">Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is
mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives,
then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers.</span>  <span class="s s86">When you
take people like this and put them together with other ambitious
people, they bloom like dying plants given water.</span>  <span class="s s87">Probably most
ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd
get from ambitious peers, whatever their age.</span><span class="s s88">
                                              
                                               [

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s89">
    Achievements also tend to increase your ambition.  With each step
you gain confidence to stretch further next time.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s90">So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of
willfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition.</span>   <span class="s s91">And
fortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated.</span>
<span class="s s92">You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can
definitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practically
malnourished when it comes to ambition.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s94">I feel like I understand determination a bit better now.</span>  <span class="s s95">But only
a bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almost
as complicated as determination.</span><span class="s s96">
                                                    
                                                     [

    </a>
    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s97">Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story.</span>
<span class="s s98">There's a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work.</span><span class="s s99">
If you really
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/love.html">
     love
    </a>
    working on something,
you don't need determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway.</span>
<span class="s s100">But most types of work have aspects one doesn't like, because most
types of work consist of doing things for other people, and it's
very unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen to
align exactly with what you want to do.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s102">
    Indeed, if you want to create the most
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">
     wealth
    </a>
    ,
the way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests,
and make up the difference with determination.</span>

Loosely speaking.</span>  <span class="s s106">What I'm claiming with the melon seed model
is more like determination is proportionate to wd^m - k|w - d|^n,
where w is will and d discipline.</span>

Which means one of the best ways to help a society generally
is to create
    <a target="_blank" href="http://startupschool.org">
     events
    </a>
    and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">
     institutions
    </a>
    that bring ambitious
people together.</span>  <span class="s s109">It's like pulling the control rods out of a
reactor: the energy they emit encourages other ambitious people,
instead of being absorbed by the normal people they're usually
surrounded with.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s111">Conversely, it's probably a mistake to do as some European countries
have done and try to ensure none of your universities is significantly
better than the others.</span>

For example, willfulness clearly has two subcomponents,
stubbornness and energy.</span>  <span class="s s114">The first alone yields someone who's
stubbornly inert.</span>  <span class="s s115">The second alone yields someone flighty.</span>
<span class="s s116">As willful people get older or otherwise lose their energy, they
tend to become merely stubborn.</span>
