   <span class="s s4">Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the
blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.</span>  <span class="s s5">The winners
slow down the least.</span>  <span class="s s6">It's that way with most startups too.</span>  <span class="s s7">The
earliest phase is usually the most productive.</span>  <span class="s s8">That's when they
have the really big ideas.</span>  <span class="s s9">Imagine what Apple was like when 100%
of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s11">The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different
from most people's idea of what business is like.</span>  <span class="s s12">If you looked
in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing
"business," you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups
sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint
presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to
read.</span>   <span class="s s13">Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.</span>  <span class="s s14">And
yet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s16">Why the disconnect?</span>  <span class="s s17">I think there's a general principle at work
here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they
expend on appearances to compensate.</span>  <span class="s s18">More often than not the energy
they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance
worse.</span>  <span class="s s19">A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine
modified the "sports" model of some production car to get the fastest
possible standing quarter mile.</span>  <span class="s s20">You know how they did it?</span><span class="s s21">  They
cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to
make it
   <i>
    look
   </i>
   fast.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s23">Business is broken the same way that car was.</span>  <span class="s s24">The effort that goes
into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes
organizations less productive.</span>  <span class="s s25">Suits, for example.</span>  <span class="s s26">Suits do not
help people to think better.</span>  <span class="s s27">I bet most executives at big companies
do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go
downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.</span>  <span class="s s28">That's when
you have ideas.</span>  <span class="s s29">Just imagine what a company would be like if people
could think that well at work.</span>  <span class="s s30">People do in startups, at least
some of the time.</span>  <span class="s s31">(Half the time you're in a panic because your
servers are on fire, but the other half you're thinking as deeply
as most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.</span><span class="s s32">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s33">Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what
passes for productivity in big companies.</span>  <span class="s s34">And yet conventional
ideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that
even startup founders are affected by them.</span>  <span class="s s35">In our startup, when
outsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem "professional.</span><span class="s s36">"</span> <span class="s s37">We'd
clean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a
lot of people were there during conventional office hours.</span>  <span class="s s38">In fact,
programming didn't get done by well-dressed people at clean desks
during office hours.</span>  <span class="s s39">It got done by badly dressed people (I was
notorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn
with junk at 2 in the morning.</span>  <span class="s s40">But no visitor would understand
that.</span>  <span class="s s41">Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize
real productivity when they see it.</span>  <span class="s s42">Even we were affected by the
conventional wisdom.</span>  <span class="s s43">We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding
despite being totally unprofessional.</span>  <span class="s s44">It was as if we'd created a
Formula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn't look like a car
was supposed to look.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a
high performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan
with giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk.</span>  <span class="s s47">Why not
in business?</span>  <span class="s s48">Probably because startups are so small.</span>  <span class="s s49">The really
dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people,
so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands
see business as it's practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till
now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first
year of a startup.</span>  <span class="s s52">This is what real productivity looks like.</span> <span class="s s53">This
is the Formula 1 racecar.</span>  <span class="s s54">It looks weird, but it goes fast.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s56">Of course, big companies won't be able to do everything these
startups do.</span>  <span class="s s57">In big companies there's always going to be more
politics, and less scope for individual decisions.</span>  <span class="s s58">But seeing what
startups are really like will at least show other organizations
what to aim for.</span>  <span class="s s59">The time may soon be coming when instead of
startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to
seem more like startups.</span>  <span class="s s60">That would be a good thing.</span>
