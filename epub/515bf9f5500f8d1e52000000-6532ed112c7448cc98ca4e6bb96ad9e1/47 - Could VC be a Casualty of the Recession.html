   Could VC be a Casualty of the Recession?

    (I originally wrote this at the request of a company producing
a report about entrepreneurship.  Unfortunately after reading it
they decided  it was too controversial to include.)
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,
like it usually does in bad times.</span>  <span class="s s5">But this time the result may
be different.</span>  <span class="s s6">This time the number of new startups may not decrease.</span>
<span class="s s7">And that could be dangerous for VCs.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s9">When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried
up too.</span>   <span class="s s10">There were not a lot of new startups being founded in
2003.</span>  <span class="s s11">But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years
ago.</span>  <span class="s s12">It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge.</span>  <span class="s s13">And if
they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s15">The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that
everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much
cheaper to start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s16">There are four main reasons: Moore's
law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;
the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful
programming languages mean development teams can be smaller.</span>  <span class="s s17">These
changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the
noise.</span>  <span class="s s18">In a lot of startups&mdash;probaby most startups funded by
Y Combinator&mdash;the biggest expense is simply the founders'
living expenses.</span>  <span class="s s19">We've had startups that were profitable on revenues
of $3000 a month.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">$3000 is insignificant as revenues go.</span>  <span class="s s22">Why should anyone care about
a startup making $3000 a month?</span><span class="s s23">  Because, although insignificant
as
   <i>
    revenue
   </i>
   , this amount of money can change a startup's
   <i>
    funding
   </i>
   situation completely.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s25">Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their
mind how much "runway" they have&mdash;how long they have till the
money in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,
raise more money, or go out of business.</span>  <span class="s s26">Once you cross the threshold
of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.</span>  <span class="s s27">It's
a qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and
disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed.</span>  <span class="s s28">Once
you're profitable you don't need investors' money.</span>  <span class="s s29">And because
Internet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of
profitability can be trivially low.</span>  <span class="s s30">Which means many Internet
startups don't need VC-scale investments anymore.</span>  <span class="s s31">For many startups,
VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a
nice-to-have.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s33">This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have
been largely masked so far.</span>  <span class="s s34">It was during the trough after the
Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,
but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.</span>   <span class="s s35">When
startups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting
to write checks again.</span>  <span class="s s36">And while founders may not have needed VC
money the way they used to, they were willing to take it if
offered&mdash;partly because there was a tradition of startups
taking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to
eat when given the opportunity.</span>  <span class="s s37">As long as VCs were writing checks,
founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they
needed them.</span>  <span class="s s38">There were a few startups who hit these limits
accidentally because of their unusual circumstances&mdash;most
famously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into
startup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting
firm, so they had revenue before they had a product.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s40">VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted
together.</span>  <span class="s s41">Around 2000 the bolt was removed.</span>  <span class="s s42">Because the components
have so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to
be joined together, but really one is just resting on the other.</span>
<span class="s s43">A sharp impact would make them fly apart.</span>  <span class="s s44">And the present recession
could be that impact.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s46">Because of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum,
we'd be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and
investors, and we are in fact seeing it.</span>  <span class="s s47">For example, though the
stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious,
it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who
want to start startups.</span>  <span class="s s48">We take applications for funding every 6
months.</span>  <span class="s s49">Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October
17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record
number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy
continues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of
interest among potential founders.</span>  <span class="s s52">That's different from the way
things felt in 2001.</span>  <span class="s s53">Then there was a widespread feeling among
potential founders that startups were over, and that one should
just go to grad school.</span>   <span class="s s54">That isn't happening this time, and part
of the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to
build something that makes $3000 a month.</span>  <span class="s s55">If investors stop writing
checks, who cares?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s57">We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors
in the attitudes of existing startups we've funded.</span>  <span class="s s58">I was talking
to one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute
over the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they
have the upper hand&mdash;over an uncertainty about whether the
founders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe
that.</span>  <span class="s s59">And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their
traffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off.</span>  <span class="s s60">So I asked
them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors.</span>  <span class="s s61">To my
surprise, they said no&mdash;that they'd just spent four months
dealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now
that they didn't have to.</span>  <span class="s s62">There was a friend they wanted to hire
with the investor money, and now they'd have to postpone that.</span>  <span class="s s63">But
otherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it to
profitability.</span>  <span class="s s64">To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment.</span>
<span class="s s65">And in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s67">I've detected this "investors aren't worth the trouble" vibe from
several YC founders I've talked to recently.</span>  <span class="s s68">At least one startup
from the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money,
let alone VC.</span><span class="s s69">
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ticketstumbler.com">
    Ticketstumbler
   </a>
   made it to profitability on Y Combinator's $15,000 investment and
they hope not to need more.</span>  <span class="s s70">This surprised even us.</span>  <span class="s s71">Although YC
is based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we never
anticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing
more than YC funding.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s73">If founders decide VCs aren't worth the trouble, that could be bad
for VCs.</span>  <span class="s s74">When the economy bounces back in a few years and they're
ready to write checks again, they may find that founders have moved
on.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s76">There is a founder community just as there's a VC community.</span>  <span class="s s77">They
all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them.</span>
<span class="s s78">If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider
and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it.</span>
<span class="s s79">And the same is true for funding.</span>  <span class="s s80">The current generation of founders
want to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, because
Larry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically.</span>
<span class="s s81">Imagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot company
didn't take VC at all.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s83">VCs think they're playing a zero sum game.</span>  <span class="s s84">In fact, it's not even
that.</span>  <span class="s s85">If you lose a deal to Benchmark, you lose that deal, but VC
as an industry still wins.</span>  <span class="s s86">If you lose a deal to None, all VCs
lose.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s88">This recession may be different from the one after the Internet
Bubble.</span>  <span class="s s89">This time founders may keep starting startups.</span>  <span class="s s90">And if
they do, VCs will have to keep writing checks, or they could become
irrelevant.</span>
