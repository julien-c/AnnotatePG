   Mind the Gap
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   May 2004
  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">When people care enough about something to do it well, those who
do it best tend to be far better than everyone else.</span>  <span class="s s4">There's a
huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like
Borgognone.</span>  <span class="s s5">You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the
average writer of detective novels.</span>  <span class="s s6">A top-ranked professional chess
player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player
without losing once.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s8">Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very
specialized skill.</span>   <span class="s s9">But for some reason we treat this skill
differently.</span>  <span class="s s10">No one complains when a few people surpass all the
rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make
more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s12">Why?</span>  <span class="s s13">The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other
skill.</span>  <span class="s s14">What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is
making money?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s16">I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:
the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable
way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and
the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for
society.</span>  <span class="s s17">As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second
outdated, and the third empirically false.</span>  <span class="s s18">Could it be that, in a
modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s20">
   The Daddy Model of Wealth
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric
sockets.</span>  <span class="s s22">I didn't realize there were power plants out there
generating it.</span>  <span class="s s23">Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth
is something that has to be generated.</span>  <span class="s s24">It seems to be something
that flows from parents.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children
tend to misunderstand wealth.</span>  <span class="s s27">They confuse it with money.</span>  <span class="s s28">They
think that there is a fixed amount of it.</span>  <span class="s s29">And they think of it as
something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be
distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created
(and might be created unequally).</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s31">In fact, wealth is not money.</span>  <span class="s s32">Money is just a convenient way of
trading one form of wealth for another.</span>  <span class="s s33">Wealth is the underlying
stuff&acirc;&#128;&#148;the goods and services we buy.</span>  <span class="s s34">When you travel to a
rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank
accounts to tell which kind you're in.</span><span class="s s35">  You can
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   wealth&acirc;&#128;&#148;in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health
of the people.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s37">Where does wealth come from?</span>  <span class="s s38">People make it.</span>  <span class="s s39">This was easier to
grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things
they wanted with their own hands.</span>  <span class="s s40">Then you could see in the house,
the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.</span>  <span class="s s41">It
was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed
quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.</span>  <span class="s s42">If you
wanted more wealth, you could make it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s44">This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly
for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).</span>  <span class="s s45">Mostly
we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we
then trade for the forms of wealth we want.</span><span class="s s46">

   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s47">Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has
to be given to them.</span>  <span class="s s48">And when wealth is something you're given,
then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.</span><span class="s s49">
                           
                            [

                           As in most families it is.</span>  <span class="s s50">The kids see to that.</span>  <span class="s s51">"Unfair," they
cry, when one sibling gets more than another.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s53">In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents.</span>  <span class="s s54">If you
want something, you either have to make it, or do something of
equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you
enough money to buy it.</span>  <span class="s s55">In the real world, wealth is (except for
a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have
to create, not something that's distributed by Daddy.</span>  <span class="s s56">And since
the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,
it's not made equally.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s58">You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those
who make more money are often simply better at doing what people
want.</span>  <span class="s s59">Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.</span>  <span class="s s60">The
B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go
to the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want
that extra oomph that the big stars have.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s62">Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.</span>
<span class="s s63">You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.</span>
<span class="s s64">Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for
some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root
cause of variation in income.</span>  <span class="s s65">The root cause of variation in income,
as Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation
in every other human skill.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s67">In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about
100 times as much as the average person.</span><span class="s s68">

                                   Basketball players
make about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.</span>
<span class="s s69">Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror.</span>  <span class="s s70">But I have
no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive
as another.</span><span class="s s71">  In ancient Rome the price of
   <i>
    slaves
   </i>
   varied by
a factor of 50 depending on their skills.</span><span class="s s72">

                                   And that's without
considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that
you can get from modern technology.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s74">Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early
Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the
Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.</span><span class="s s75">

                                     How much someone's work is worth is not a policy question.</span>  <span class="s s76">It's
something the market already determines.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s78">"Are they really worth 100 of us?</span><span class="s s79">"</span> <span class="s s80">editorialists ask.</span>  <span class="s s81">Depends on
what you mean by worth.</span>  <span class="s s82">If you mean worth in the sense of what
people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s84">A few CEOs' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.</span>  <span class="s s85">But are there
not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?</span>
<span class="s s86">Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.</span>  <span class="s s87">And not
merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;
he had to decide what Apple's next products should be.</span>  <span class="s s88">Few others
could have done it.</span>  <span class="s s89">And regardless of the case with CEOs, it's
hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional
basketball players don't reflect supply and demand.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s91">It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really
generate so much more wealth than another.</span>  <span class="s s92">The key to this mystery
is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?</span><span class="s s93">
   <i>
    Would
   </i>
   a basketball team trade one of their players for 100
random people?</span>  <span class="s s94">What would Apple's next product look like if you
replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people?</span><span class="s s95">

                                           These
things don't scale linearly.</span>  <span class="s s96">Perhaps the CEO or the professional
athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and
determination of an ordinary person.</span>  <span class="s s97">But it makes all the difference
that it's concentrated in one individual.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s99">When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,
what are we really saying?</span>  <span class="s s100">In a free market, prices are determined
by what buyers want.</span>  <span class="s s101">People like baseball more than  poetry, so
baseball players make more than poets.</span>  <span class="s s102">To say that a certain kind
of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want
the wrong things.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s104">Well, of course people want the wrong things.</span>  <span class="s s105">It seems odd to be
surprised by that.</span><span class="s s106">  And it seems even odder to say that it's
   <i>
    unjust
   </i>
   that certain kinds of work are underpaid.</span><span class="s s107">

                                               Then
you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.</span>
<span class="s s108">It's  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to
Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?</span>  <span class="s s109">That seems like
saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">The appearance of the word "unjust" here is the unmistakable spectral
signature of the Daddy Model.</span>  <span class="s s112">Why else would this idea occur in
this odd context?</span>  <span class="s s113">Whereas if the speaker were still operating on
the Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a
common source and had to be shared out, rather than something
generated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what
you'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s115">When we talk about "unequal distribution of income," we should
also ask, where does that income come from?</span><span class="s s116">

                                                   Who made the wealth
it represents?</span>  <span class="s s117">Because to the extent that income varies simply
according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may
be unequal, but it's hardly unjust.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s119">
   Stealing It
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s120">The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth
alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate
a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;
in agricultural societies by appropriating others' estates in times
of war, and taxing them in times of peace.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s122">In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates
confiscated from the losers.</span>  <span class="s s123">In England in the 1060s, when William
the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon
nobles to his followers, the conflict was military.</span>  <span class="s s124">By the 1530s,
when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his
followers, it was mostly political.</span><span class="s s125">
                                                         
                                                          [

                                                         But the principle was the
same.</span>  <span class="s s126">Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s128">In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials
used taxation instead of confiscation.</span>  <span class="s s129">But here too we see the
same principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but
to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s131">This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.</span>
<span class="s s132">Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor
poor, but originally they were a distinct group.</span>  <span class="s s133">In a feudal
society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the
serfs who work their estates.</span>  <span class="s s134">The middle class were a new, third
group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing
and trade.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s136">Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and
former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful
enough to ignore the local feudal lords.</span><span class="s s137">

                                                               Like serfs, the middle
class made a living largely by creating wealth.</span>  <span class="s s138">(In port cities
like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.</span><span class="s s139">) But unlike serfs
they had an incentive to create a lot of it.</span>  <span class="s s140">Any wealth a serf
created belonged to his master.</span>  <span class="s s141">There was not much point in making
more than you could hide.</span>  <span class="s s142">Whereas the independence of the townsmen
allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s144">Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as
a whole started to get richer very rapidly.</span>  <span class="s s145">Nearly everything we
have was created by the middle class.</span>  <span class="s s146">Indeed, the other two classes
have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their
names been given to either end of the middle class.</span>  <span class="s s147">(In the original
sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.</span><span class="s s148">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s149">But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation
definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.</span>  <span class="s s150">In
England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in
fact only started to be called "corruption") when there started to
be other, faster ways to get rich.</span>

   The Lever of Technology
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s184">Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor?</span>  <span class="s s185">It will
certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.</span>
<span class="s s186">That's the whole point of technology.</span>   <span class="s s187">With a tractor an energetic
farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with
a team of horses.</span>  <span class="s s188">But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s190">I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.</span>  <span class="s s191">In
high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at
Baskin-Robbins.</span>  <span class="s s192">This was the only kind of work available at the
time.</span>  <span class="s s193">Now high school kids could write software or design web
sites.</span>  <span class="s s194">But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping
ice cream.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s196">I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it
possible for me to buy a computer of my own.</span>  <span class="s s197">Within months I was
using it to make money as a freelance programmer.</span>  <span class="s s198">A few years
before, I couldn't have done this.</span><span class="s s199">  A few years before, there was
no such
   <i>
    thing
   </i>
   as a freelance programmer.</span>  <span class="s s200">But Apple created
wealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers
immediately set to work using it to create more.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s202">As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases
our productive capacity is probably polynomial, rather than linear.</span>
<span class="s s203">So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual
productivity as time goes on.</span>   <span class="s s204">Will that increase the gap between
rich and the poor?</span>  <span class="s s205">Depends which gap you mean.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s207">Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to
decrease other gaps.</span><span class="s s208">  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different
   <i>
    kind
   </i>
   of life from ordinary people.</span>  <span class="s s209">They lived in houses
full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and
travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves
required their own houses and servants.</span>  <span class="s s210">Now, thanks to technology,
the rich live more like the average person.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s212">Cars are a good example of why.</span>  <span class="s s213">It's possible to buy expensive,
handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span>  <span class="s s214">But there
is not much point.</span>  <span class="s s215">Companies make more money by building a large
number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.</span>  <span class="s s216">So
a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more
on its design.</span>  <span class="s s217">If you buy a custom-made car, something will always
be breaking.</span>  <span class="s s218">The only point of buying one now is to advertise that
you can.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s220">Or consider watches.</span>  <span class="s s221">Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money
on a watch you could get better performance.</span>  <span class="s s222">When watches had
mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.</span>  <span class="s s223">Not any
more.</span>  <span class="s s224">Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex
is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands
of dollars.</span><span class="s s225">

to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some
inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical
watches have to be wound.</span>

   <span class="s s227">The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand.</span>  <span class="s s228">Which is precisely

label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having
it versus not having it.</span>  <span class="s s231">In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one
asked what year or brand it was.</span>  <span class="s s232">If you had one, you were rich.</span>
<span class="s s233">And if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked.</span>  <span class="s s234">Now even
the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so
well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially
expensive ones.</span><span class="s s235">

   Alternative to an Axiom
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s273">One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would
increase the income gap between rich and poor.</span>  <span class="s s274">As if it were an
axiom that this would be bad.</span><span class="s s275">  It might be true that increased
variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say
it's
   <i>
    axiomatic.
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s276">Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.</span>  <span class="s s277">In a
society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a
sign of an underlying problem.</span>  <span class="s s278">But serfdom is not the only cause
of variation in income.</span>  <span class="s s279">A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much
as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her
in thrall.</span>  <span class="s s280">His skills are simply much more valuable.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s282">I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,
increasing variation in income is a sign of health.</span>  <span class="s s283">Technology
seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than
linear rates.</span>  <span class="s s284">If we don't see corresponding variation in income,
there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation
has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth
aren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s286">I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.</span>  <span class="s s287">If you
disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available
to the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.</span>

  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s290">The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous
society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),
that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.</span>
<span class="s s291">That Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour
days to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,
after taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they
would have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s293">Will people create wealth if they can't get paid for it?</span>  <span class="s s294">Only if
it's fun.</span>  <span class="s s295">People will write operating systems for free.</span>  <span class="s s296">But they
won't install them, or take support calls, or train customers to
use them.</span>  <span class="s s297">And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech
companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s299">All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society
that confiscates private fortunes.</span>  <span class="s s300">We can confirm this empirically.</span>
<span class="s s301">Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a
nearby fan.</span>  <span class="s s302">You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.</span>  <span class="s s303">You turn
the fan back on, and the noise starts again.</span>  <span class="s s304">Off, quiet.</span>  <span class="s s305">On,
noise.</span>  <span class="s s306">In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise
is caused by the fan.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s308">At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate
a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off.</span>  <span class="s s309">Northern
Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it).</span>  <span class="s s310">Northern Italy in
1100, on.</span>  <span class="s s311">Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).</span>  <span class="s s312">England in
1800, on.</span>  <span class="s s313">England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).</span>
<span class="s s314">United States in 1974, on.</span>  <span class="s s315">We've even had a twin study: West
Germany, on;  East Germany, off.</span>  <span class="s s316">In every case, the creation of
wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you
switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s318">There is some momentum involved.</span>  <span class="s s319">It probably takes at least a
generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).</span>
<span class="s s320">But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra
baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one
would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s322">If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private
fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as
some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be
the same.</span>    <span class="s s323">Society as a whole ends up poorer.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s325">If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially
much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one
where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take
the first option.</span>  <span class="s s326">If I had children, it would arguably be immoral
not to.</span>  <span class="s s327">It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative
poverty.</span>  <span class="s s328">If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one
or the other in your society, take relative poverty.</span>

One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and
reality is the valuation of hard work.</span>  <span class="s s394">In the Daddy Model, hard
work is in itself deserving.</span>  <span class="s s395">In reality, wealth is measured by
what one delivers, not how much effort it costs.</span>  <span class="s s396">If I paint someone's
house, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s398">It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy
Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get
paid much.</span>  <span class="s s399">To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else
and put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.</span>
<span class="s s400">If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much
food.</span>  <span class="s s401">Is this unfair?</span>  <span class="s s402">Who is being unfair to him?</span>

Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be
the dual meaning of "distribution.</span><span class="s s405">"</span> <span class="s s406">When economists talk about
"distribution of income," they mean statistical distribution.</span>  <span class="s s407">But
when you use the phrase frequently, you can't help associating it
with the other sense of the word (as in e.</span><span class="s s408">g.</span> <span class="s s409">"distribution of alms"),
and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows
from some central tap.</span><span class="s s410">  The word "regressive" as applied to tax
rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything
   <i>

   be good?</span>

"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous
courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.</span>
<span class="s s413">In 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom
of Rutland.</span>  <span class="s s414">In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome,
his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to
vote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason

him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property.</span><span class="s s415">"</span>

If asked to choose which was more expensive, a well-preserved
1989 Lincoln Town Car ten-passenger limousine ($5,000) or a 2004
Mercedes S600 sedan ($122,000), the average Edwardian might well
guess wrong.</span>

To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to
talk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy.</span>
<span class="s s442">But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the
growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price
index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are
only locally accurate, and that don't include the prices of new
inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s444">So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world
with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than
without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will
prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s446">Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the
year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade
goods to make your fortune?</span>  <span class="s s447">For example, if you were going back
to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing
power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least
$150 million in 1970.</span>  <span class="s s448">The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly,
because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you
needed in present-day trash.</span>  <span class="s s449">In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle
with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.</span>

Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich
have better opportunities for education.</span>  <span class="s s452">That's a valid point.</span>  <span class="s s453">It
is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top
colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the
college admissions process.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s455">According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education
Statistics, about 1.</span><span class="s s456">7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian
schools.</span>  <span class="s s457">At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such
schools.</span>  <span class="s s458">(Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly
lower, about 28%.</span><span class="s s459">)  Obviously this is a huge loophole.</span>  <span class="s s460">It does at
least seem to be closing, not widening.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s462">Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson
from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming
that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it
is.</span>
