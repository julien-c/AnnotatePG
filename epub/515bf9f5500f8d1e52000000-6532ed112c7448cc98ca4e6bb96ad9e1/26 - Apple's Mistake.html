    <span class="s s3">I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken.</span>  <span class="s s4">Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters
that it's broken.</span>

    <span class="s s6">The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they've ever done.</span> 
<span class="s s7">Their reputation with programmers used to be great.</span>
<span class="s s8">It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.</span>
<span class="s s9">The App Store has changed that.</span>  <span class="s s10">Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s12">How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store?</span>  <span class="s s13">A third?</span>  <span class="s s14">Half?</span>  <span class="s s15">And that's just so far.</span>

   <p><span class="s s19">
    How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem is
that they don't understand software.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes.</span>  <span class="s s21">Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly.</span>  <span class="s s22">But this model doesn't work for software.</span>  <span class="s s23">It doesn't
work for an intermediary to own the user.</span>  <span class="s s24">The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words "software" and "publisher" fit together,
the underlying concepts don't.</span>  <span class="s s25">Software isn't like music or books.</span>
<span class="s s26">It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user.</span>   <span class="s s27">And yet that's what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher.</span>  <span class="s s28">And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones.</span>  <span class="s s31">But Apple doesn't
understand that either.</span>  <span class="s s32">Their model of product development derives
from hardware.</span>  <span class="s s33">They work on something till they think it's finished,
then they release it.</span>  <span class="s s34">You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.</span>
<span class="s s35">The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate.</span>  <span class="s s36">Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s38">Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store.</span>  <span class="s s39">They would say
that.</span>  <span class="s s40">But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology.</span>  <span class="s s41">Programmers don't use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.</span>  <span class="s s42">They use it because it
yields the best results.</span>  <span class="s s43">By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s45">How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in
OS&Acirc;&nbsp;X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had
to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month
and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s47">By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what
they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App
Store tends to be an old and buggy one.</span>  <span class="s s48">One developer told me:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s49">As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked
  applications.</span> <span class="s s50">I make a new version almost every day that I release
  to beta users.</span> <span class="s s51">The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.</span>
  <span class="s s52">I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is
  "I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store", and it's
  combined with the emotion "Really, it's Apple's fault.</span><span class="s s53">"</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s55">
    Another wrote:
    </span><blockquote>
     <span class="s s56">I believe that they think their approval process helps users by
  ensuring quality.</span>  <span class="s s57">In reality, bugs like ours get through all the
  time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,
  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.</span>
  <span class="s s58">Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms
  that have immediate approval processes.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s60">
    Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the
complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.
They must hear developers complaining.  But partners and suppliers
are always complaining.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't;
it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Meanwhile the iPhone
is selling better than ever.  So why do they need to fix anything?
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s61">They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because
they make such great hardware.</span>  <span class="s s62">I just bought a new 27" iMac a
couple days ago.</span>  <span class="s s63">It's fabulous.</span>  <span class="s s64">The screen's too shiny, and the
disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't
make yourself care.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s66">So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.</span>
<span class="s s67">I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a
bad human rights record.</span>  <span class="s s68">That was new.</span>  <span class="s s69">In the past when I bought
things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.</span>  <span class="s s70">Oh boy!</span>  <span class="s s71">They make
such great stuff.</span>  <span class="s s72">This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.</span>  <span class="s s73">They
make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.</span>  <span class="s s74">Do I really want
to support this company?</span>

   <p><span class="s s77">
    Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">There are a couple reasons they should care.</span>  <span class="s s79">One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.</span>  <span class="s s80">If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won't work for you.</span>  <span class="s s81">That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.</span>  <span class="s s82">Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.</span>  <span class="s s83">It seemed like selling out.</span>  <span class="s s84">When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side.</span>  <span class="s s85">But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.</span>  <span class="s s86">It was the
people they never got.</span>  <span class="s s87">And you know who got them?</span>  <span class="s s88">Google and
Apple.</span>  <span class="s s89">If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.</span>
<span class="s s90">And it's largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?</span>  <span class="s s93">Partly
because they can afford to be.</span>  <span class="s s94">The best programmers can work
wherever they want.</span>  <span class="s s95">They don't have to work for a company they
have qualms about.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s97">But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity.</span>  <span class="s s98">An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.</span>  <span class="s s99">And it's
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren't the ones that win.</span>  <span class="s s100">I think the reason Google embraced "Don't
be evil" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.</span><span class="s s101">

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s102">That has worked for Google so far.</span>  <span class="s s103">They've become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles.</span> <span class="s s104">With Apple that seems less the case.</span><span class="s s105">  When you
look at the famous
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uriahcarpenter.info/1984.html">
     1984 ad
    </a>
    now, it's easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.</span><span class="s s106">
                                          
                                           [

                                          In fact, if you read the dictator's speech it sounds uncannily like a
prophecy of the App Store.</span>
    </p><blockquote><span class="s s108">
     We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.
    </span></blockquote>
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s109">We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
  pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
  of contradictory and confusing truths.</span>
    <span class="s s110">The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them
is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.</span>  <span class="s s111">If
anyone should know this, Apple should.</span>  <span class="s s112">VisiCalc made the Apple II.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s114">And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.</span>  <span class="s s115">Most
applications&acirc;&#128;&#148;most startups, probably&acirc;&#128;&#148;grow out of personal projects.</span>
<span class="s s116">Apple itself did.</span>  <span class="s s117">Apple made microcomputers because that's what
Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.</span>  <span class="s s118">He couldn't have afforded a
minicomputer.</span><span class="s s119">
                                            
                                             [

    </a>
    ]
                                            
                                            Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters
for little microcomputers because
Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.</span>  <span class="s s120">It's a
rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s122">The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers
have iPhones.</span>  <span class="s s123">They may know, because they read it in an article,
that Blackberry has such and such market share.</span>  <span class="s s124">But in practice
it's as if RIM didn't exist.</span> <span class="s s125">If they're going to build something,
they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building
an iPhone app.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s127">So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple
continues to maltreat them.</span>  <span class="s s128">They're like someone stuck in an abusive
relationship.</span>  <span class="s s129">They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't
leave.</span>  <span class="s s130">But they're looking for a way out.</span>  <span class="s s131">One wrote:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s132">While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they
  place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop
  applications as I would like.</span> <span class="s s133">In fact I don't intend to make any
  more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.</span><span class="s s134">
                                                 
                                                  [
     <a name="f4" href="#f4n">
      4
     </a>
     ]
    </span></blockquote><span class="s s135">
    Can anything break this cycle?  No device I've seen so far could.
Palm and RIM haven't a hope.  The only credible contender is Android.
But Android is an orphan; Google doesn't really care about it, not
the way Apple cares about the iPhone.  Apple cares about the iPhone
the way Google cares about search.

   <p>
    <span class="s s137">Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?</span>  <span class="s s138">It's
a worrying prospect.</span>  <span class="s s139">It would be a bummer to have another grim
monoculture like we had in the 1990s.</span>  <span class="s s140">In 1995, writing software
for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows
applications.</span><span class="s s141">  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest
thing that drove us to start building
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/road.html">
     web apps
    </a>
    .</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s143">At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.</span>
<span class="s s144">You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.</span>  <span class="s s145">If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop
apps for that instead.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s147">How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?</span>
<span class="s s148">It's unlikely you could make something better designed.</span>  <span class="s s149">Apple
leaves no room there.</span>  <span class="s s150">So this alternative device probably couldn't
win on general appeal.</span>  <span class="s s151">It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s153">One way to appeal to programmers is with software.</span>  <span class="s s154">If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s156">That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds
as development machines&acirc;&#128;&#148;if handhelds displaced laptops the
way laptops displaced desktops.</span>  <span class="s s157">You need more control of a development
machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s159">Could anyone make a device that you'd carry around in your pocket
like a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?</span>
<span class="s s160">It's hard to imagine what it would look like.</span>  <span class="s s161">But I've learned
never to say never about technology.</span>  <span class="s s162">A phone-sized device that
would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present
standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards
of 1995.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s164">My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with
an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when
traveling.</span>  <span class="s s165">If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.</span>
<span class="s s166">That still wouldn't be small enough to carry around everywhere like
a phone, but we're within a factor of 4 or so.</span>  <span class="s s167">Surely that gap is
bridgeable.</span><span class="s s168">  In fact, let's make it an
