   Snapshot: Viaweb, June 1998
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   January 2012
  </span></h2>
  <p><span class="s s3">
   A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998
I took a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb">
    snapshot of Viaweb's
site
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s4">I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s6">The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.</span>  <span class="s s7">Screens
were a lot smaller in 1998.</span>  <span class="s s8">If I remember correctly, our frontpage
used to just fit in the size window people typically used then.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts
and they weren't antialiased.</span>  <span class="s s11">If you wanted to make pages that
looked good, you had to render display text as images.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s13">
   You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">
    Y Combinator
   </a>
   logos.</span>  <span class="s s14">We did that
as an inside joke when we started YC.</span>  <span class="s s15">Considering how basic a red
circle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how
few other companies used one as their logo.</span><span class="s s16">  A bit later I realized
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/zero.html">
    why
   </a>
   .</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s18">
   On the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/com.html">
    Company
page
   </a>
   you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.</span><span class="s s19">
Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">
    Worm
   </a>
   that he
didn't want his name on the site.</span>  <span class="s s20">I managed to get him to agree
to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.</span><span class="s s21">  He has
since
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/people.html">
    relaxed
   </a>
   a bit
on that point.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s23">Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the
course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire
PhD.</span><span class="s s24">  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases
was one
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/trevor.html">
    celebrating
his graduation
   </a>
   , illustrated with a drawing I did of him during
a meeting.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s26">
   (Trevor also appears as
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tlbwebdesign.html">
    Trevino
Bagwell
   </a>
   in our directory of web designers merchants could hire
to build stores for them.</span>  <span class="s s27">We inserted him as a ringer in case some
competitor tried to spam our web designers.</span>   <span class="s s28">We assumed his logo
would deter any actual customers, but it did not.</span><span class="s s29">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s30">Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines
and newspapers.</span>  <span class="s s31">There were not the same ways to get found online
that there are today.</span><span class="s s32">  So we used to pay a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/submarine.html">
    PR
firm
   </a>
   $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.</span><span class="s s33">  Fortunately
reporters
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/presquot.html">
    liked
us
   </a>
   .</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s35">
   In our
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/se.html">
    advice about
getting traffic from search engines
   </a>
   (I don't think the term SEO
had been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,
AltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.</span>  <span class="s s36">Notice
anything missing?</span>  <span class="s s37">Google was incorporated that September.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s39">
   We supported online transactions via a company called
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberCash,_Inc.">
    Cybercash
   </a>
   ,
since if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product
comparisons.</span>  <span class="s s40">But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes
were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.</span><span class="s s41">  We had a page in our site trying to
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/cybercash.html">
    talk merchants
out of doing real time authorizations
   </a>
   .</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s43">
   The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tesdriv.html">
    test drive
   </a>
   .</span>
<span class="s s44">It was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.</span>  <span class="s s45">We put
cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our
software worked.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s47">
   We had some
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/us.html">
    well
known users
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s48">Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the
most traffic.</span>  <span class="s s49">We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,
so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.</span>
<span class="s s50">I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,
and it was about $300/month.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just
over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what
at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.</span>  <span class="s s53">We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)
coming into our offices.</span>  <span class="s s54">In those days there was no AWS.</span>  <span class="s s55">Even
colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things
went wrong with them.</span>  <span class="s s56">So we had our servers in our offices.</span>  <span class="s s57">Or
more precisely, in Trevor's office.</span>  <span class="s s58">In return for the unique
privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to
share it with 6 shrieking tower servers.</span>  <span class="s s59">His office was nicknamed
the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.</span>  <span class="s s60">Most days his
stack of window air conditioners could keep up.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s62">
   For describing pages, we had a template language called
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/rtml.html">
    RTML
   </a>
   , which
supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after
Rtm.</span>  <span class="s s63">RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,
and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it
had syntax.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s65">Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have
versions.</span>  <span class="s s66">But in those days the trade press expected versions, so
we made them up.</span><span class="s s67">  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made
the version number
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/rel4.html">
    an
integer
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s68">That "version 4.</span><span class="s s69">0" icon was generated by our own
button generator, incidentally.</span>  <span class="s s70">The whole Viaweb site was made
with our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because
we wanted to experience what our users did.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s72">
   At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search
engine called
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/shoprel.html">
    Shopfind
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s73">It
was pretty advanced for the time.</span>  <span class="s s74">It had a programmable crawler
that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out
the products.</span>
