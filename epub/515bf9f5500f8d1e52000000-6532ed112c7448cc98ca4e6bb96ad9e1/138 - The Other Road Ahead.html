   The Other Road Ahead
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   September 2001
  </span></h2>
  <p><span class="s s3">
   <i>
    (This article explains why much of the next generation of software
may be server-based, what that will mean for programmers,
and why this new kind of software is a great opportunity for startups.
It's derived from a talk at BBN Labs.)
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I decided to
start a startup.</span>  <span class="s s5">The PR campaign leading up to Netscape's IPO was
running full blast then, and there was a lot of talk in the press
about online commerce.</span>  <span class="s s6">At the time there might have been thirty
actual stores on the Web, all made by hand.</span>  <span class="s s7">If there were going
to be a lot of online stores, there would need to be software for making
them, so we decided to write some.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s9">For the first week or so we intended to make this an ordinary   
desktop application.</span>  <span class="s s10">Then one day we had the idea of making the
software run on our Web server, using the browser as an
interface.</span>  <span class="s s11">We tried rewriting the software to work over
the Web, and it was clear that this was the way to go.</span>
<span class="s s12">If we wrote our software to run on the server, it would be a lot easier
for the users and for us as well.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">This turned out to be a good plan.</span><span class="s s15">  Now, as
   <a target="_blank" href="http://store.yahoo.com">
    Yahoo Store
   </a>
   , this
software is the most popular online store builder, with
about 14,000 users.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">When we started Viaweb, hardly anyone understood what we meant when
we said that the software ran on the server.</span>  <span class="s s18">It was not until
Hotmail was launched a year later that people started to get it.</span>
<span class="s s19">Now everyone knows that this is a valid approach.</span>  <span class="s s20">There is
a name now for what we were: an Application Service Provider,
or ASP.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">I think that a lot of the next generation of software will be
written on this model.</span>  <span class="s s23">Even Microsoft, who have the most to
lose, seem to see the inevitablity of moving some things off
the desktop.</span> <span class="s s24">If software moves
off the desktop and onto servers, it will mean a very different
world for developers.</span>  <span class="s s25">This article describes the surprising
things we saw, as some of the first visitors to this new world.</span>
<span class="s s26">To the extent software does move onto
servers, what I'm describing here is the future.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s28">
   The Next Thing?
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s29">When we look back on the desktop software era, I think we'll marvel
at the inconveniences people put up with, just as we marvel now at
what early car owners put up with.</span>  <span class="s s30">For the first twenty or thirty
years, you had to be a car expert to own a car.</span>  <span class="s s31">But cars were such
a big win that lots of people who weren't car experts wanted to
have them as well.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s33">Computers are in this phase now.</span>  <span class="s s34">When you own a desktop computer,
you end up learning a lot more than you wanted to know about what's
happening inside it.</span>  <span class="s s35">But more than half the households in the US
own one.</span>  <span class="s s36">My mother has a computer that she uses for email and for
keeping accounts.</span>  <span class="s s37">About a year ago she was alarmed to receive a
letter from Apple, offering her a discount on a new version of the
operating system.</span>  <span class="s s38">There's something wrong when a sixty-five year
old woman who wants to use a computer for email and accounts has
to think about installing new operating sytems.  Ordinary users
shouldn't even know the words "operating system," much less "device
driver" or "patch.</span><span class="s s39">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">There is now another way to deliver software that will save users
from becoming system administrators.</span>  <span class="s s42">Web-based applications are
programs that run on Web servers and use Web pages as the user
interface.</span>  <span class="s s43">For the average user this new kind of software will be
easier, cheaper, more mobile, more reliable, and often more powerful
than desktop software.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s45">With Web-based software, most users won't have to think about
anything except the applications they use.</span>  <span class="s s46">All the messy, changing
stuff will be sitting on a server somewhere, maintained by the kind
of people who are good at that kind of thing.</span>  <span class="s s47">And so you won't
ordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software.</span>  <span class="s s48">All you'll
need will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser.</span>
<span class="s s49">Maybe it will have wireless Internet access.</span>  <span class="s s50">Maybe it will also
be your cell phone.</span>  <span class="s s51">Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics:
something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostly
based on how the case looks.</span>  <span class="s s52">You'll pay more for Internet services
than you do for the hardware, just as you do now with telephones.</span> <span class="s s53">[1]</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s54">It will take about a tenth of a second for a click to get to the
server and back, so users of heavily interactive software, like
Photoshop, will still want to have the computations happening on
the desktop.</span>  <span class="s s55">But if you look at the kind of things most people
use computers for, a tenth of a second latency would not be a
problem.</span>  <span class="s s56">My mother doesn't really need a desktop computer, and
there are a lot of people like her.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s58">
   The Win for Users
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s59">Near my house there is a car with a bumper sticker that reads "death
before inconvenience.</span><span class="s s60">"</span>  <span class="s s61">Most people, most of the time, will take
whatever choice requires least work.</span>  <span class="s s62">If Web-based software wins,
it will be because it's more convenient.</span>  <span class="s s63">And it looks as if it
will be, for users and developers both.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s65">To use a purely Web-based application, all you need is a browser
connected to the Internet.</span>  <span class="s s66">So you can use a Web-based application
anywhere.</span>  <span class="s s67">When you install software on your desktop computer, you
can only use it on that computer.</span>  <span class="s s68">Worse still, your files are
trapped on that computer.</span>  <span class="s s69">The inconvenience of this model becomes
more and more evident as people get used to networks.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s71">The thin end of the wedge here was Web-based email.</span>  <span class="s s72">Millions of
people now realize that you should have access to email messages
no matter where you are.</span>  <span class="s s73">And if you can see your email, why not
your calendar?</span>  
<span class="s s74">If you can discuss a document with your colleagues,
why can't you edit it?</span>  <span class="s s75">Why should any of your data be trapped on
some computer sitting on a faraway desk?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s77">The whole idea of "your computer" is going away, and being replaced
with "your data.</span><span class="s s78">"</span>  <span class="s s79">You should be able to get at your data from any
computer.</span>  <span class="s s80">Or rather, any client, and a client doesn't have to be
a computer.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s82">Clients shouldn't store data; they should be like telephones.</span>  <span class="s s83">In
fact they may become telephones, or vice versa.</span>  <span class="s s84">And as clients
get smaller, you have another reason not to keep your data on them:
something you carry around with you can be lost or stolen.</span><span class="s s85">   Leaving
your PDA in a taxi is like a disk crash, except that your data is
handed to
   <a target="_blank" href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,2077931,00.htm">
    someone else
   </a>
   instead of being vaporized.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">With purely Web-based software, neither your data nor the applications
are kept on the client.</span>  <span class="s s88">So you don't have to install anything to
use it.</span>  <span class="s s89">And when there's no installation, you don't have to worry
about installation going wrong.</span>  <span class="s s90">There can't be incompatibilities
between the application and your operating system, because the
software doesn't run on your operating system.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s92">Because it needs no installation, it will be easy, and common, to
try Web-based software before you "buy" it.</span>  <span class="s s93">You should expect to
be able to test-drive any Web-based application for free, just by
going to the site where it's offered.</span>  <span class="s s94">At Viaweb our whole site
was like a big arrow pointing users to the test drive.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s96">After trying the demo, signing up for the service should require
nothing more than filling out a brief form (the briefer the better).</span>
<span class="s s97">And that should be the last work the user has to do.</span>  <span class="s s98">With Web-based
software, you should get new releases without paying extra, or
doing any work, or possibly even knowing about it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s100">Upgrades won't be the big shocks they are now.</span>  <span class="s s101">Over time applications
will quietly grow more powerful.</span>  <span class="s s102">This will take some effort on
the part of the developers.</span>  <span class="s s103">They will have to design software so
that it can be updated without confusing the users.</span>  <span class="s s104">That's a new
problem, but there are ways to solve it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s106">With Web-based applications, everyone uses the same version, and
bugs can be fixed as soon as they're discovered.</span>  <span class="s s107">So Web-based
software should have far fewer bugs than desktop software.</span>  <span class="s s108">At
Viaweb, I doubt we ever had ten known bugs at any one time.</span>  <span class="s s109">That's
orders of magnitude better than desktop software.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">Web-based applications can be used by several people at the same
time.</span>  <span class="s s112">This is an obvious win for collaborative applications, but
I bet users will start to want this in most applications once they
realize it's possible.</span>  <span class="s s113">It will often be useful to let two people
edit the same document, for example.</span>  <span class="s s114">Viaweb let multiple users
edit a site simultaneously, more because that was the right way to
write the software than because we expected users to want to, but
it turned out that many did.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s116">When you use a Web-based application, your data will be safer.</span>
<span class="s s117">Disk crashes won't be a thing of the past, but users won't hear
about them anymore.</span>  <span class="s s118">They'll happen within server farms.  And
companies offering Web-based applications will actually do backups--
not only because they'll have real system administrators worrying
about such things, but because an ASP that does lose people's data
will be in big, big trouble.</span>  <span class="s s119">When people lose their own data in
a disk crash, they can't get that mad, because they only have
themselves to be mad at.</span>  <span class="s s120">When a company loses their data for them,
they'll get a lot madder.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s122">Finally, Web-based software should be less vulnerable to viruses.</span>
<span class="s s123">If the client doesn't run anything except a browser, there's less
chance of running viruses, and no data locally to damage.</span>  <span class="s s124">And a
program that attacked the servers themselves should find them very
well defended.</span> <span class="s s125">[2]</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s126">
   For users, Web-based software will be
   <i>
    less stressful.
   </i>
   I think if
you looked inside the average Windows user you'd find a huge and
pretty much untapped desire for software meeting that description.</span>
<span class="s s127">Unleashed, it could be a powerful force.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s129">
   City of Code
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s130">To developers, the most conspicuous difference between Web-based
and desktop software is that a Web-based application is not a single
piece of code.</span>  <span class="s s131">It will be a collection of programs of different
types rather than a single big binary.</span>  <span class="s s132">And so designing Web-based
software is like desiging a city rather than a building: as well
as buildings you need roads, street signs, utilities, police and
fire departments, and plans for both growth and various kinds of
disasters.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s134">At Viaweb, software included fairly big applications that users
talked to directly, programs that those programs used, programs
that ran constantly in the background looking for problems, programs
that tried to restart things if they broke, programs that ran
occasionally to compile statistics or build indexes for searches,
programs we ran explicitly to garbage-collect resources or to move
or restore data, programs that pretended to be users (to measure
performance or expose bugs), programs for diagnosing network
troubles, programs for doing backups, interfaces to outside services,
software that drove an impressive collection of dials displaying
real-time server statistics (a hit with visitors, but indispensable
for us too), modifications (including bug fixes) to open-source
software, and a great many configuration files and settings.</span>  <span class="s s135">Trevor
Blackwell wrote a spectacular program for moving stores to new
servers across the country, without shutting them down, after we
were bought by Yahoo.</span> <span class="s s136">Programs paged us, sent faxes and email to
users, conducted transactions with credit card processors, and
talked to one another through sockets, pipes, http requests, ssh,
udp packets, shared memory, and files.</span>  <span class="s s137">Some of Viaweb even consisted
of the absence of programs, since one of the keys to Unix security
is not to run unnecessary utilities that people might use to break
into your servers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s139">It did not end with software.</span>  <span class="s s140">We spent a lot of time thinking
about server configurations.</span>  <span class="s s141">We built the servers ourselves, from
components-- partly to save money, and partly to get exactly what
we wanted.</span>  <span class="s s142">We had to think about whether our upstream ISP had fast
enough connections to all the backbones.</span><span class="s s143">  We serially
   <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=6hdipo%243o0%241%40FreeBSD.csie.NCTU.edu.tw">
    dated
   </a>
   RAID suppliers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s145">But hardware is not just something to worry about.</span>  <span class="s s146">When you control
it you can do more for users.</span>  <span class="s s147">With a desktop application, you can
specify certain minimum hardware, but you can't add more.</span>  <span class="s s148">If you
administer the servers, you can in one step enable all your users
to page people, or send faxes, or send commands by phone, or process
credit cards, etc, just by installing the relevant hardware.</span>  <span class="s s149">We
always looked for new ways to add features with hardware, not just
because it pleased users, but also as a way to distinguish ourselves
from competitors who (either because they sold desktop software,
or resold Web-based applications through ISPs) didn't have direct
control over the hardware.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s151">Because the software in a Web-based application will be a collection
of programs rather than a single binary, it can be written in any
number of different languages.</span>  <span class="s s152">When you're writing desktop software,
you're practically forced to write the application in the same
language as the underlying operating system-- meaning C and C++.</span>
<span class="s s153">And so these languages (especially among nontechnical people like
managers and VCs) got to be considered as the languages for "serious"
software development.</span>  <span class="s s154">But that was just an artifact of the way
desktop software had to be delivered.</span>  <span class="s s155">For server-based software
you can use any language you want.</span> <span class="s s156">[3]  Today a lot of the top
hackers are using languages far removed from C and C++:  Perl,
Python, and even Lisp.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s158">With server-based software, no one can tell you what language to
use, because you control the whole system, right down to the
hardware.</span>  <span class="s s159">Different languages are good for different tasks.</span>  <span class="s s160">You
can use whichever is best for each.</span>  <span class="s s161">And when you have competitors,
"you can" means "you must" (we'll return to this later), because
if you don't take advantage of this possibility, your competitors
will.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s163">Most of our competitors used C and C++, and this made their software
visibly inferior because (among other things), they had no way
around the statelessness of CGI scripts.</span>  <span class="s s164">If you were going to
change something, all the changes had to happen on one page, with
an Update button at the bottom.</span><span class="s s165">  As I've written elsewhere, by
using
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">
    Lisp
   </a>
   , which many people still consider 
a research language,
we could make the Viaweb editor behave more like desktop software.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s167">
   Releases
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s168">One of the most important changes in this new world is the way you
do releases.</span> <span class="s s169">In the desktop software business, doing a release is
a huge trauma, in which the whole company sweats and strains to
push out a single, giant piece of code.</span>  <span class="s s170">Obvious comparisons suggest
themselves, both to the process and the resulting product.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s172">With server-based software, you can make changes almost as you
would in a program you were writing for yourself.</span>  <span class="s s173">You release
software as a series of incremental changes instead of an occasional
big explosion.</span> <span class="s s174">A typical desktop software company might do one or
two releases a year.</span>  <span class="s s175">At Viaweb we often did three to five releases
a day.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s177">When you switch to this new model, you realize how much software
development is affected by the way it is released.</span>  <span class="s s178">Many of the
nastiest problems you see in the desktop software business are due
to catastrophic nature of releases.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s180">When you release only one new version a year, you tend to deal with
bugs wholesale.</span>  <span class="s s181">Some time before the release date you assemble a
new version in which half the code has been torn out and replaced,
introducing countless bugs.</span>  <span class="s s182">Then a squad of QA people step in and
start counting them, and the programmers work down the list, fixing
them.</span>  <span class="s s183">They do not generally get to the end of the list, and indeed,
no one is sure where the end is.</span>  <span class="s s184">It's like fishing rubble out of
a pond.</span>  <span class="s s185">You never really know what's happening inside the software.</span>
<span class="s s186">At best you end up with a statistical sort of correctness.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s188">With server-based software, most of the change is small and
incremental.</span>  <span class="s s189">That in itself is less likely to introduce bugs.</span>  <span class="s s190">It
also means you know what to test most carefully when you're about
to release software: the last thing you changed.</span>  <span class="s s191">You end up with
a much firmer grip on the code.</span>  <span class="s s192">As a general rule, you do know
what's happening inside it.</span>  <span class="s s193">You don't have the source code memorized,
of course, but when you read the source you do it like a pilot
scanning the instrument panel, not like a detective trying to
unravel some mystery.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s195">Desktop software breeds a certain fatalism about bugs.</span>  <span class="s s196">You know
that you're shipping something loaded with bugs, and you've even
set up mechanisms to compensate for it (e.</span><span class="s s197">g.</span> <span class="s s198">patch releases).</span>  <span class="s s199">So
why worry about a few more?</span>  <span class="s s200">Soon you're releasing whole features
you know are broken.</span><span class="s s201">
   <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-5195914.html">
    Apple
   </a>
   did this earlier this year.</span>  <span class="s s202">They felt
under pressure to release their new OS, whose release date had
already slipped four times, but some of the software (support for
CDs and DVDs) wasn't ready.</span> <span class="s s203">The solution?</span>  <span class="s s204">They released the OS
without the unfinished parts, and users will have to install them
later.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s206">
   With Web-based software, you never have to release software before
it works, and you can release it as soon as it does work.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s207">The industry veteran may be thinking, it's a fine-sounding idea to
say that you never have to release software before it works, but
what happens when you've promised to deliver a new version of your
software by a certain date?</span>  <span class="s s208">With Web-based software, you wouldn't
make such a promise, because there are no versions.</span>  <span class="s s209">Your software
changes gradually and continuously.</span>  <span class="s s210">Some changes might be bigger
than others, but the idea of versions just doesn't naturally fit
onto Web-based software.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s212">If anyone remembers Viaweb this might sound odd, because we were
always announcing new versions.</span>  <span class="s s213">This was done entirely for PR
purposes.</span>  <span class="s s214">The trade press, we learned, thinks in version numbers.</span>
<span class="s s215">They will give you major coverage for a major release, meaning a
new first digit on the version number, and generally a paragraph
at most for a point release, meaning a new digit after the decimal
point.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s217">Some of our competitors were offering desktop software and actually
had version numbers.</span>  <span class="s s218">And for these releases, the mere fact of
which seemed to us evidence of their backwardness, they would get
all kinds of publicity.</span>  <span class="s s219">We didn't want to miss out, so we started
giving version numbers to our software too.</span>  <span class="s s220">When we wanted some
publicity, we'd make a list of all the features we'd added since
the last "release," stick a new version number on the software,
and issue a press release saying that the new version was available
immediately.</span>  <span class="s s221">Amazingly, no one ever called us on it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s223">By the time we were bought, we had done this three times, so we
were on Version 4.</span>  <span class="s s224">Version 4.</span><span class="s s225">1 if I remember correctly.</span>  <span class="s s226">After
Viaweb became Yahoo Store, there was no longer such a desperate
need for publicity, so although the software continued to evolve,
the whole idea of version numbers was quietly dropped.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s228">
   Bugs
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s229">The other major technical advantage of Web-based software is that
you can reproduce most bugs.</span>  <span class="s s230">You have the users' data right there
on your disk.</span>  <span class="s s231">If someone breaks your software, you don't have to
try to guess what's going on, as you would with desktop software:
you should be able to reproduce the error while they're on the
phone with you.</span>  <span class="s s232">You might even know about it already, if you have
code for noticing errors built into your application.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s234">
   Web-based software gets used round the clock, so everything you do
is immediately put through the wringer.  Bugs turn up quickly.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s235">Software companies are sometimes accused of letting the users debug
their software.</span>  <span class="s s236">And that is just what I'm advocating.</span>  <span class="s s237">For Web-based
software it's actually a good plan, because the bugs are fewer and
transient.</span>  <span class="s s238">When you release software gradually you get far fewer
bugs to start with.</span>  <span class="s s239">And when you can reproduce errors and release
changes instantly, you can find and fix most bugs as soon as they
appear.</span>  <span class="s s240">We never had enough bugs at any one time to bother with
a formal bug-tracking system.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s242">You should test changes before you release them, of course, so no
major bugs should get released.</span>  <span class="s s243">Those few that inevitably slip
through will involve borderline cases and will only affect the few
users that encounter them before someone calls in to complain.</span>  <span class="s s244">As
long as you fix bugs right away, the net effect, for the average
user, is far fewer bugs.</span>  <span class="s s245">I doubt the average Viaweb user ever saw
a bug.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s247">Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones.</span>  <span class="s s248">It's usually
fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote.</span>  <span class="s s249">When it turns
up you often know what's wrong before you even look at the source,
because you were already worrying about it subconsciously.</span> <span class="s s250">Fixing
a bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case if
you release once a year) is a lot more work.</span>  <span class="s s251">And since you don't
understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an
ugly way, or even introduce more bugs.</span> <span class="s s252">[4]</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s253">When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs.</span>
<span class="s s254">Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:  you trip going
downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in
your hand.</span>  <span class="s s255">In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find,
and also tends to have the worst consequences.</span> <span class="s s256">[5]  The traditional
"break everything and then filter out the bugs" approach inherently
yields a lot of compound bugs.</span>  <span class="s s257">And software that's released in a
series of small changes inherently tends not to.</span> <span class="s s258">The floors are
constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later
get stuck in something.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s260">It helps if you use a technique called functional programming.</span>
<span class="s s261">Functional programming means avoiding side-effects.</span>  <span class="s s262">It's something
you're more likely to see in research papers than commercial
software, but for Web-based applications it turns out to be really
useful.</span>  <span class="s s263">It's hard to write entire programs as purely functional
code, but you can write substantial chunks this way.</span>  <span class="s s264">It makes
those parts of your software easier to test, because they have no
state, and that is very convenient in a situation where you are
constantly making and testing small modifications.</span><span class="s s265">  I wrote much
of Viaweb's editor in this style, and we made our scripting language,
   <a target="_blank" href="http://store.yahoo.com/rtml.html">
    RTML
   </a>
   , 
a purely functional language.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s267">People from the desktop software business will find this hard to
credit, but at Viaweb bugs became almost a game.</span>  <span class="s s268">Since most released
bugs involved borderline cases, the users who encountered them were
likely to be advanced users, pushing the envelope.</span>  <span class="s s269">Advanced users
are more forgiving about bugs, especially since you probably
introduced them in the course of adding some feature they were
asking for.</span>  <span class="s s270">In fact, because bugs were rare and you had to be
doing sophisticated things to see them, advanced users were often
proud to catch one.</span>  <span class="s s271">They would call support in a spirit more of
triumph than anger, as if they had scored points off us.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s273">
   Support
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s274">When you can reproduce errors, it changes your approach to customer
support.</span>  <span class="s s275">At most software companies, support is offered as a way
to make customers feel better.</span>  <span class="s s276">They're either calling you about
a known bug, or they're just doing something wrong and you have to
figure out what.</span>  <span class="s s277">In either case there's not much you can learn
from them.</span>  <span class="s s278">And so you tend to view support calls as a pain in the
ass that you want to isolate from your developers as much as
possible.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s280">This was not how things worked at Viaweb.</span>  <span class="s s281">At Viaweb, support was
free, because we wanted to hear from customers.</span>  <span class="s s282">If someone had a
problem, we wanted to know about it right away so that we could
reproduce the error and release a fix.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s284">So at Viaweb the developers were always in close contact with
support.</span>  <span class="s s285">The customer support people were about thirty feet away
from the programmers, and knew that they could always interrupt
anything with a report of a genuine bug.</span>  <span class="s s286">We would leave a board
meeting to fix a serious bug.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s288">Our approach to support made everyone happier.</span>  <span class="s s289">The customers were
delighted.</span>  <span class="s s290">Just imagine how it would feel to call a support line
and be treated as someone bringing important news.</span>  <span class="s s291">The customer
support people liked it because it meant they could help the users,
instead of reading scripts to them.</span>  <span class="s s292">And the programmers liked it
because they could reproduce bugs instead of just hearing vague
second-hand reports about them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s294">Our policy of fixing bugs on the fly changed the relationship
between customer support people and hackers.</span>  <span class="s s295">At most software
companies, support people are underpaid human shields, and hackers
are little copies of God the Father, creators of the world.</span>  <span class="s s296">Whatever
the procedure for reporting bugs, it is likely to be one-directional:
support people who hear about bugs fill out some form that eventually
gets passed on (possibly via QA) to programmers, who put it on
their list of things to do.</span>  <span class="s s297">It was very different at Viaweb.</span>
<span class="s s298">Within a minute of hearing about a bug from a customer, the support
people could be standing next to a programmer hearing him say "Shit,
you're right, it's a bug.</span><span class="s s299">"</span> <span class="s s300">It delighted the support people to hear
that "you're right" from the hackers.</span>  <span class="s s301">They used to bring us bugs
with the same expectant air as a cat bringing you a mouse it has
just killed.</span>   <span class="s s302">It also made them more careful in judging the
seriousness of a bug, because now their honor was on the line.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s304">After we were bought by Yahoo, the customer support people were
moved far away from the programmers.</span>  <span class="s s305">It was only then that we
realized that they were effectively QA and to some extent marketing
as well.</span>  <span class="s s306">In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of
the knowledge of vaguer, buglike things, like features that confused
users.</span> <span class="s s307">[6]  They were also a kind of proxy focus group; we could
ask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they were
always right.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s309">
   Morale
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s310">Being able to release software immediately is a big motivator.</span>
<span class="s s311">Often as I was walking to work I would think of some change I wanted
to make to the software, and do it that day.</span>  <span class="s s312">This worked for bigger
features as well.</span>  <span class="s s313">Even if something was going to take two weeks
to write (few projects took longer), I knew I could see the effect
in the software as soon as it was done.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s315">If I'd had to wait a year for the next release, I would have shelved
most of these ideas, for a while at least.</span>  <span class="s s316">The thing about ideas,
though, is that they lead to more ideas.</span>  <span class="s s317">Have you ever noticed
that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end
up in it are ones you thought of while writing it?</span>  <span class="s s318">The same thing
happens with software.</span>  <span class="s s319">Working to implement one idea gives you
more ideas.</span>  <span class="s s320">So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in
implementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would
have led to.</span>  <span class="s s321">In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new
ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight
of the shelf and think "but I already have a lot of new things I
want to do for the next release.</span><span class="s s322">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s324">What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan
them.</span>  <span class="s s325">At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account.</span>
<span class="s s326">Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the
future.</span>  <span class="s s327">The truthful answer would have been, we didn't have any
plans.</span>  <span class="s s328">We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve,
but if we knew how we would have done it already.</span>  <span class="s s329">What were we
going to do in the next six months?</span> <span class="s s330">Whatever looked like the biggest
win.</span>  <span class="s s331">I don't know if I ever dared give this answer, but that was
the truth.</span>  <span class="s s332">Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf.</span>
<span class="s s333">When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s335">At Viaweb, as at many software companies, most code had one definite
owner.</span>  <span class="s s336">But when you owned something you really owned it: no one
except the owner of a piece of software had to approve (or even
know about) a release.</span>  <span class="s s337">There was no protection against breakage
except the fear of looking like an idiot to one's peers, and that
was more than enough.</span>  <span class="s s338">I may have given the impression that we just
blithely plowed forward writing code.</span>  <span class="s s339">We did go fast, but we
thought very carefully before we released software onto those
servers.</span>  <span class="s s340">And paying attention is more important to reliability
than moving slowly.</span>  <span class="s s341">Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot
can land a 40,000 lb.</span> <span class="s s342">aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching
carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can
cut a bagel.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s344">This way of writing software is a double-edged sword of course.</span>
<span class="s s345">It works a lot better for a small team of good, trusted programmers
than it would for a big company of mediocre ones, where bad ideas
are caught by committees instead of the people that had them.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s347">
   Brooks in Reverse
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s348">Fortunately, Web-based software does require fewer programmers.</span>
<span class="s s349">I once worked for a medium-sized desktop software company that had
over 100 people working in engineering as a whole.</span>  <span class="s s350">Only 13 of
these were in product development.</span>  <span class="s s351">All the rest were working on
releases, ports, and so on.</span>  <span class="s s352">With Web-based software, all you need
(at most) are the 13 people, because there are no releases, ports,
and so on.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s354">Viaweb was written by just three people.</span> <span class="s s355">[7]  I was always under
pressure to hire more, because we wanted to get bought, and we knew
that buyers would have a hard time paying a high price for a company
with only three programmers.</span>  <span class="s s356">(Solution:  we hired more, but created
new projects for them.</span><span class="s s357">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s358">When you can write software with fewer programmers, it saves you
more than money.</span><span class="s s359">  As Fred Brooks pointed out in
   <i>
    The Mythical
Man-Month,
   </i>
   adding people to a project tends to slow it down.</span>  <span class="s s360">The
number of possible connections between developers grows exponentially
with the size of the group.</span>  <span class="s s361">The larger the group, the more time
they'll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will work
together, and the more bugs they'll get from unforseen interactions.</span>
<span class="s s362">Fortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get
smaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient.</span>
<span class="s s363">I can't remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actual
meeting.</span>  <span class="s s364">We never had more to say at any one time than we could
say as we were walking to lunch.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s366">If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers have
to be to some degree system administrators as well.</span>  <span class="s s367">When you're
hosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and in
practice the only people who can do this properly are the ones who
wrote the software.</span>  <span class="s s368">At Viaweb our system had so many components
and changed so frequently that there was no definite border between
software and infrastructure.</span>  <span class="s s369">Arbitrarily declaring such a border
would have constrained our design choices.</span>  <span class="s s370">And so although we were
constantly hoping that one day ("in a couple months") everything
would be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job was
just to worry about the servers, it never happened.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s372">I don't think it could be any other way, as long as you're still
actively developing the product.</span>  <span class="s s373">Web-based software is never going
to be something you write, check in, and go home.</span>  <span class="s s374">It's a live
thing, running on your servers right now.</span>  <span class="s s375">A bad bug might not just
crash one user's process; it could crash them all.</span>  <span class="s s376">If a bug in
your code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it.</span>  <span class="s s377">And so
on.</span>  <span class="s s378">We found that you don't have to watch the servers every minute
(after the first year or so), but you definitely want to keep an
eye on things you've changed recently.</span>  <span class="s s379">You don't release code late
at night and then go home.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s381">
   Watching Users
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s382">With server-based software, you're in closer touch with your code.</span>
<span class="s s383">You can also be in closer touch with your users.</span>  <span class="s s384">Intuit is famous
for introducing themselves to customers at retail stores and asking
to follow them home.</span>  <span class="s s385">If you've ever watched someone use your
software for the first time, you know what surprises must have
awaited them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s387">Software should do what users think it will.</span>  <span class="s s388">But you can't have
any idea what users will be thinking, believe me, until you watch
them.</span>  <span class="s s389">And server-based software gives you unprecedented information
about their behavior.</span>  <span class="s s390">You're not limited to small, artificial
focus groups.</span>  <span class="s s391">You can see every click made by every user.</span>  <span class="s s392">You
have to consider carefully what you're going to look at, because
you don't want to violate users' privacy, but even the most general
statistical sampling can be very useful.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s394">When you have the users on your server, you don't have to rely on
benchmarks, for example.</span>  <span class="s s395">Benchmarks are simulated users.</span>  <span class="s s396">With
server-based software, you can watch actual users.</span>  <span class="s s397">To decide what
to optimize, just log into a server and see what's consuming all
the CPU.</span>  <span class="s s398">And you know when to stop optimizing too: we eventually
got the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound rather
than CPU-bound, and since there was nothing we could do to decrease
the size of users' data (well, nothing easy), we knew we might as
well stop there.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s400">Efficiency matters for server-based software, because you're paying
for the hardware.</span>  <span class="s s401">The number of users you can support per server
is the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your software
very efficient you can undersell competitors and still make a
profit.</span>  <span class="s s402">At Viaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about
$5.</span>  <span class="s s403">It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sending
them the first month's bill.</span>  <span class="s s404">Hardware is free now, if your software
is reasonably efficient.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s406">Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization.</span>
<span class="s s407">Viaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced users
define their own page styles.</span>  <span class="s s408">We found that RTML became a kind of
suggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined page
styles couldn't do what they wanted.</span><span class="s s409">  Originally the editor put
button bars across the page, for example, but after a number of
users used RTML to put buttons down the left
   <a target="_blank" href="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_1656_3563">
    side
   </a>
   , 
we made that an
option (in fact the default) in the predefined page styles.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s411">Finally, by watching users you can often tell when they're in
trouble.</span>  <span class="s s412">And since the customer is always right, that's a sign of
something you need to fix.</span>  <span class="s s413">At Viaweb the key to getting users was
the online test drive.</span>  <span class="s s414">It was not just a series of slides built
by marketing people.</span>  <span class="s s415">In our test drive, users actually used the
software.</span>  <span class="s s416">It took about five minutes, and at the end of it they
had built a real, working store.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <!--[The <a target="_blank" href="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/RT/SIGNUP-STORE">test drive</a> 
is still online, but now
they make you fill out several forms, and don't tell you
that you've created a working store.  If you try the test
drive, here is how to find your store: if you choose foo as your
store id, the finished store will be at store.yahoo.com/foo.]
--><span class="s s418">
   The test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users.  I
think it will be the same for most Web-based applications.   If
users can get through a test drive successfully, they'll like the
product.  If they get confused or bored, they won't.  So anything
we could do to get more people through the test drive would increase
our growth rate.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s419">I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found
that at a certain step they would get confused and click on the
browser's Back button.</span>  <span class="s s420">(If you try writing Web-based applications,
you'll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interesting
philosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, telling
users that they were nearly finished, and reminding them not to
click on the Back button.</span>  <span class="s s421">Another great thing about Web-based
software is that you get instant feedback from changes:  the number
of people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to
90%.</span>  <span class="s s422">And since the number of new users was a function of the number
of completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, just
from that change.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s424">
   Money
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s425">In the early 1990s I read an article in which someone said that
software was a subscription business.</span>  <span class="s s426">At first this seemed a very
cynical statement.</span>  <span class="s s427">But later I realized that it reflects reality:
software development is an ongoing process.</span>  <span class="s s428">I think it's cleaner
if you openly charge subscription fees, instead of forcing people
to keep buying and installing new versions so that they'll keep
paying you.</span>  <span class="s s429">And fortunately, subscriptions are the natural way to
bill for Web-based applications.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s431">Hosting applications is an area where companies will play a role
that is not likely to be filled by freeware.</span>  <span class="s s432">Hosting applications
is a lot of stress, and has real expenses.</span>  <span class="s s433">No one is going to want
to do it for free.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s435">For companies, Web-based applications are an ideal source of revenue.</span>
<span class="s s436">Instead of starting each quarter with a blank slate, you have a
recurring revenue stream.</span>  <span class="s s437">Because your software evolves gradually,
you don't have to worry that a new model will flop; there never
need be a new model, per se, and if you do something to the software
that users hate, you'll know right away.</span>  <span class="s s438">You have no trouble with
uncollectable bills; if someone won't pay you can just turn off
the service.</span>  <span class="s s439">And there is no possibility of piracy.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s441">That last "advantage" may turn out to be a problem.</span>  <span class="s s442">Some amount
of piracy is to the advantage of software companies.</span>  <span class="s s443">If some user
really would not have bought your software at any price, you haven't
lost anything if he uses a pirated copy.</span>  <span class="s s444">In fact you gain, because
he is one more user helping to make your software the standard--
or who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s446">When they can, companies like to do something called price
discrimination, which means charging each customer as much as they
can afford.</span> <span class="s s447">[8] Software is particularly suitable for price
discrimination, because the marginal cost is close to zero.</span>  <span class="s s448">This
is why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes:
a company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and can
safely be charged more.</span>  <span class="s s449">Piracy is effectively the lowest tier of
price discrimination.</span>  <span class="s s450">I think that software companies understand
this and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy.</span> <span class="s s451">[9] 
With server-based software they are going to have to come up with 
some other solution.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s453">Web-based software sells well, especially in comparison to desktop
software, because it's easy to buy.</span>  <span class="s s454">You might think that people
decide to buy something, and then buy it, as two separate steps.</span>
<span class="s s455">That's what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought about
the question at all.</span>  <span class="s s456">In fact the second step can propagate back
into the first: if something is hard to buy, people will change
their mind about whether they wanted it.</span>  <span class="s s457">And vice versa: you'll
sell more of something when it's easy to buy.</span>  <span class="s s458">I buy more books
because Amazon exists.</span>  <span class="s s459">Web-based software is just about the easiest
thing in the world to buy, especially if you have just done an
online demo.</span>  <span class="s s460">Users should not have to do much more than enter a
credit card number.</span>  <span class="s s461">(Make them do more at your peril.</span><span class="s s462">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s463">Sometimes Web-based software is offered through ISPs acting as
resellers.</span>  <span class="s s464">This is a bad idea.</span>  <span class="s s465">You have to be administering the
servers, because you need to be constantly improving both hardware
and software.</span>  <span class="s s466">If you give up direct control of the servers, you
give up most of the advantages of developing Web-based applications.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s468">Several of our competitors shot themselves in the foot this way--
usually, I think, because they were overrun by suits who were
excited about this huge potential channel, and didn't realize that
it would ruin the product they hoped to sell through it.</span>  <span class="s s469">Selling
Web-based software through ISPs is like selling sushi through
vending machines.</span>

   <span class="s s472">Who will the customers be?</span>  <span class="s s473">At Viaweb they were initially individuals
and smaller companies, and I think this will be the rule with
Web-based applications.</span>  <span class="s s474">These are the users who are ready to try
new things, partly because they're more flexible, and partly because
they want the lower costs of new technology.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s476">Web-based applications will often be the best thing for big companies
too (though they'll be slow to realize it).</span>  <span class="s s477">The best intranet is
the Internet.</span>  <span class="s s478">If a company uses true Web-based applications, the
software will work better, the servers will be better administered,
and employees will have access to the system from anywhere.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s480">The argument against this approach usually hinges on security: if
access is easier for employees, it will be for bad guys too.</span>  <span class="s s481">Some
larger merchants were reluctant to use Viaweb because they thought
customers' credit card information would be safer on their own
servers.</span>  <span class="s s482">It was not easy to make this point diplomatically, but
in fact the data was almost certainly safer in our hands than
theirs.</span>  <span class="s s483">Who can hire better people to manage security, a technology
startup whose whole business is running servers, or a clothing
retailer?</span>  <span class="s s484">Not only did we have better people worrying about
security, we worried more about it.</span>  <span class="s s485">If someone broke into the
clothing retailer's servers, it would affect at most one merchant,
could probably be hushed up, and in the worst case might get one
person fired.</span>  <span class="s s486">If someone broke into ours, it could affect thousands
of merchants, would probably end up as news on CNet, and could put
us out of business.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s488">If you want to keep your money safe, do you keep it under your
mattress at home, or put it in a bank?</span> <span class="s s489">This argument applies to
every aspect of server administration:  not just security, but
uptime, bandwidth, load management, backups, etc.</span>  <span class="s s490">Our existence
depended on doing these things right.</span>  <span class="s s491">Server problems were the
big no-no for us, like a dangerous toy would be for a toy maker,
or a salmonella outbreak for a food processor.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s493">A big company that uses Web-based applications is to that extent
outsourcing IT.</span>  <span class="s s494">Drastic as it sounds, I think this is generally
a good idea.</span>  <span class="s s495">Companies are likely to get better service this way
than they would from in-house system administrators.</span>  <span class="s s496">System
administrators can become cranky and unresponsive because they're
not directly exposed to competitive pressure:  a salesman has to
deal with customers, and a developer has to deal with competitors'
software, but a system administrator, like an old bachelor, has
few external forces to keep him in line.</span> <span class="s s497">[10]  At Viaweb we had
external forces in plenty to keep us in line.</span> <span class="s s498">The people calling
us were customers, not just co-workers.</span>  <span class="s s499">If a server got wedged,
we jumped; just thinking about it gives me a jolt of adrenaline,
years later.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s501">So Web-based applications will ordinarily be the right answer for
big companies too.</span>  <span class="s s502">They will be the last to realize it, however,
just as they were with desktop computers.</span>  <span class="s s503">And partly for the same
reason: it will be worth a lot of money to convince big companies
that they need something more expensive.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s505">There is always a tendency for rich customers to buy expensive
solutions, even when cheap solutions are better, because the people
offering expensive solutions can spend more to sell them.</span>  <span class="s s506">At Viaweb
we were always up against this.</span>  <span class="s s507">We lost several high-end merchants
to Web consulting firms who convinced them they'd be better off if
they paid half a million dollars for a custom-made online store on
their own server.</span>  <span class="s s508">They were, as a rule, not better off, as more
than one discovered when Christmas shopping season came around and
loads rose on their server.</span>  <span class="s s509">Viaweb was a lot more sophisticated
than what most of these merchants got, but we couldn't afford to
tell them.</span>  <span class="s s510">At $300 a month, we couldn't afford to send a team of
well-dressed and authoritative-sounding people to make presentations
to customers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s512">A large part of what big companies pay extra for is the cost of
selling expensive things to them.</span>  <span class="s s513">(If the Defense Department pays
a thousand dollars for toilet seats, it's partly because it costs
a lot to sell toilet seats for a thousand dollars.</span><span class="s s514">)  And this is
one reason intranet software will continue to thrive, even though
it is probably a bad idea.</span>  <span class="s s515">It's simply more expensive.</span>  <span class="s s516">There is
nothing you can do about this conundrum, so the best plan is to go
for the smaller customers first.</span>  <span class="s s517">The rest will come in time.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s519">
   Son of Server
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s520">Running software on the server is nothing new.</span>  <span class="s s521">In fact it's the
old model: mainframe applications are all server-based.</span>  <span class="s s522">If
server-based software is such a good idea, why did it lose last
time?</span>  <span class="s s523">Why did desktop computers eclipse mainframes?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s525">At first desktop computers didn't look like much of a threat.</span>  <span class="s s526">The
first users were all hackers-- or hobbyists, as they were called
then.</span>  <span class="s s527">They liked microcomputers because they were cheap.</span>  <span class="s s528">For the
first time, you could have your own computer.</span>  <span class="s s529">The phrase "personal
computer" is part of the language now, but when it was first used
it had a deliberately audacious sound, like the phrase "personal
satellite" would today.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s531">Why did desktop computers take over?</span> <span class="s s532">I think it was because they
had better software.</span>  <span class="s s533">And I think the reason microcomputer software
was better was that it could be written by small companies.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s535">I don't think many people realize how fragile and tentative startups
are in the earliest stage.</span>  <span class="s s536">Many startups begin almost by accident--
as a couple guys, either with day jobs or in school, writing a
prototype of something that might, if it looks promising, turn into
a company.</span> <span class="s s537">At this larval stage, any significant obstacle will stop
the startup dead in its tracks.</span>  <span class="s s538">Writing mainframe software required
too much commitment up front.</span>  <span class="s s539">Development machines were expensive,
and because the customers would be big companies, you'd need an
impressive-looking sales force to sell it to them.</span>  <span class="s s540">Starting a
startup to write mainframe software would be a much more serious
undertaking than just hacking something together on your Apple II
in the evenings.</span>  <span class="s s541">And so you didn't get a lot of startups writing
mainframe applications.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s543">The arrival of desktop computers inspired a lot of new software,
because writing applications for them seemed an attainable goal to
larval startups.</span>  <span class="s s544">Development was cheap, and the customers would
be individual people that you could reach through computer stores
or even by mail-order.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s546">
   The application that pushed desktop computers out into the mainstream
was
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bricklin.com/visicalc.htm">
    VisiCalc
   </a>
   , the 
first spreadsheet.</span>  <span class="s s547">It was written by two guys
working in an attic, and yet did things no mainframe software could
do.</span> <span class="s s548">[11]  VisiCalc was such an advance, in its time, that people
bought Apple IIs just to run it.</span>  <span class="s s549">And this was the beginning of a
trend: desktop computers won because startups wrote software for
them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s551">It looks as if server-based software will be good this time around,
because startups will write it.</span>  <span class="s s552">Computers are so cheap now that
you can get started, as we did, using a desktop computer as a
server.</span>  <span class="s s553">Inexpensive processors have eaten the workstation market
(you rarely even hear the word now) and are most of the way through
the server market; Yahoo's servers, which deal with loads as high
as any on the Internet, all have the same inexpensive Intel processors
that you have in your desktop machine.</span>  <span class="s s554">And once you've written
the software, all you need to sell it is a Web site.</span>  <span class="s s555">Nearly all
our users came direct to our site through word of mouth and references
in the press.</span> <span class="s s556">[12]</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s557">Viaweb was a typical larval startup.</span>  <span class="s s558">We were terrified of starting
a company, and for the first few months comforted ourselves by
treating the whole thing as an experiment that we might call off
at any moment.</span>  <span class="s s559">Fortunately, there were few obstacles except
technical ones.</span>  <span class="s s560">While we were writing the software, our Web server
was the same desktop machine we used for development, connected to
the outside world by a dialup line.</span>  <span class="s s561">Our only expenses in that
phase were food and rent.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s563">There is all the more reason for startups to write Web-based software
now, because writing desktop software has become a lot less fun.</span>
<span class="s s564">If you want to write desktop software now you do it on Microsoft's
terms, calling their APIs and working around their buggy OS.</span>  <span class="s s565">And
if you manage to write something that takes off, you may find that
you were merely doing market research for Microsoft.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s567">If a company wants to make a platform that startups will build on,
they have to make it something that hackers themselves will want
to use.</span>   <span class="s s568">That means it has to be inexpensive and well-designed.</span>
<span class="s s569">The Mac was popular with hackers when it first came out, and a lot
of them wrote software for it.</span> <span class="s s570">[13] You see this less with Windows,
because hackers don't use it.</span>  <span class="s s571">The kind of people who are good at
writing software tend to be running Linux or FreeBSD now.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s573">I don't think we would have started a startup to write desktop
software, because desktop software has to run on Windows, and before
we could write software for Windows we'd have to use it.</span>  <span class="s s574">The Web 
let us do an end-run around Windows, and deliver software running 
on Unix direct to users through the browser.</span>  <span class="s s575">That is a liberating 
prospect, a lot like the arrival of PCs twenty-five years ago.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s577">
   Microsoft
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s578">Back when desktop computers arrived, IBM was the giant that everyone
was afraid of.</span>  <span class="s s579">It's hard to imagine now, but I remember the feeling
very well.</span>  <span class="s s580">Now the frightening giant is Microsoft, and I don't
think they are as blind to the threat facing them as IBM was.</span>
<span class="s s581">After all, Microsoft deliberately built their business in IBM's
blind spot.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s583">I mentioned earlier that my mother doesn't really need a desktop
computer.</span>  <span class="s s584">Most users probably don't.</span>  <span class="s s585">That's a problem for Microsoft,
and they know it.</span>  <span class="s s586">If applications run on remote servers, no one
needs Windows.</span>  <span class="s s587">What will Microsoft do?</span>  <span class="s s588">Will they be able to use
their control of the desktop to prevent, or constrain, this new
generation of software?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s590">My guess is that Microsoft will develop some kind of server/desktop
hybrid, where the operating system works together with servers they
control.</span>  <span class="s s591">At a minimum, files will be centrally available for users
who want that.</span>  <span class="s s592">I don't expect Microsoft to go all the way to the
extreme of doing the computations on the server, with only a browser
for a client, if they can avoid it.</span> <span class="s s593">If you only need a browser for
a client, you don't need Microsoft on the client, and if Microsoft
doesn't control the client, they can't push users towards their
server-based applications.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s595">I think Microsoft will have a hard time keeping the genie in the
bottle.</span>  <span class="s s596">There will be too many different types of clients for them
to control them all.</span>  <span class="s s597">And if Microsoft's applications only work
with some clients, competitors will be able to trump them by offering
applications that work from any client.</span> <span class="s s598">[14]</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s599">In a world of Web-based applications, there is no automatic place
for Microsoft.</span>  <span class="s s600">They may succeed in making themselves a place, but
I don't think they'll dominate this new world as they did the world
of desktop applications.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s602">It's not so much that a competitor will trip them up as that they
will trip over themselves.</span>  <span class="s s603">With the rise of Web-based software,
they will be facing not just technical problems but their own
wishful thinking.</span>  <span class="s s604">What they need to do is cannibalize their existing
business, and I can't see them facing that.</span>  <span class="s s605">The same single-mindedness
that has brought them this far will now be working against them.</span>
<span class="s s606">IBM was in exactly the same situation, and they could not master
it.</span>  <span class="s s607">IBM made a late and half-hearted entry into the microcomputer
business because they were ambivalent about threatening their cash
cow, mainframe computing.</span>  <span class="s s608">Microsoft will likewise be hampered by
wanting to save the desktop.</span>  <span class="s s609">A cash cow can be a damned heavy
monkey on your back.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s611">I'm not saying that no one will dominate server-based applications.</span>
<span class="s s612">Someone probably will eventually.</span>  <span class="s s613">But I think that there will be
a good long period of cheerful chaos, just as there was in the
early days of microcomputers.</span>  <span class="s s614">That was a good time for startups.</span>
<span class="s s615">Lots of small companies flourished, and did it by making cool
things.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s617">
   Startups but More So
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s618">The classic startup is fast and informal, with few people and little
money.</span>  <span class="s s619">Those few people work very hard, and technology magnifies
the effect of the decisions they make.</span>  <span class="s s620">If they win, they win big.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s622">In a startup writing Web-based applications, everything you associate
with startups is taken to an extreme.</span>  <span class="s s623">You can write and launch a
product with even fewer people and even less money.</span>  <span class="s s624">You have to
be even faster, and you can get away with being more informal.</span>
<span class="s s625">You can literally launch your product as three guys sitting in the
living room of an apartment, and a server collocated at an ISP.</span>
<span class="s s626">We did.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s628">Over time the teams have gotten smaller, faster, and more informal.</span>
<span class="s s629">In 1960, software development meant a roomful of men with horn
rimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, industriously writing
ten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms.  In 1980, it was a
team of eight to ten people wearing jeans to the office and typing
into vt100s.</span>  <span class="s s630">Now it's a couple of guys sitting in a living room
with laptops.</span>  <span class="s s631">(And jeans turn out not to be the last word in
informality.</span><span class="s s632">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s633">Startups are stressful, and this, unfortunately, is also taken to
an extreme with Web-based applications.</span>  
<span class="s s634">Many software companies, especially at the beginning, have periods
where the developers slept under their desks and so on.</span>  <span class="s s635">The alarming
thing about Web-based software is that there is nothing to prevent
this becoming the default.</span>  <span class="s s636">The stories about sleeping under desks
usually end:  then at last we shipped it and we all went home and
slept for a week.</span>  <span class="s s637">Web-based software never ships.</span>  <span class="s s638">You can work
16-hour days for as long as you want to.</span>  <span class="s s639">And because you can, and
your competitors can, you tend to be forced to.</span>  <span class="s s640">You can, so you
must.</span>  <span class="s s641">It's Parkinson's Law running in reverse.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s643">The worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility.</span>  <span class="s s644">Programmers
and system administrators traditionally each have their own separate
worries.</span>  <span class="s s645">Programmers have to worry about bugs, and system
administrators have to worry about infrastructure.</span>  <span class="s s646">Programmers
may spend a long day up to their elbows in source code, but at some
point they get to go home and forget about it.</span>  <span class="s s647">System administrators
never quite leave the job behind, but when they do get paged at
4:00 AM, they don't usually have to do anything very complicated.</span>
<span class="s s648">With Web-based applications, these two kinds of stress get combined.</span>
<span class="s s649">The programmers become system administrators, but without the
sharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s651">At Viaweb we spent the first six months just writing software.</span>  <span class="s s652">We
worked the usual long hours of an early startup.</span>  <span class="s s653">In a desktop
software company, this would have been the part where we were
working hard, but it felt like a vacation compared to the next
phase, when we took users onto our server.</span>  <span class="s s654">The second biggest
benefit of selling Viaweb to Yahoo (after the money) was to be able
to dump ultimate responsibility for the whole thing onto the
shoulders of a big company.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s656">Desktop software forces users to become system administrators.</span>
<span class="s s657">Web-based software forces programmers to.</span>  <span class="s s658">There is less stress in
total, but more for the programmers.</span>  <span class="s s659">That's not necessarily bad
news.</span>  <span class="s s660">If you're a startup competing with a big company, it's good
news.</span> <span class="s s661">[15]  Web-based applications offer a straightforward way to
outwork your competitors.</span>  <span class="s s662">No startup asks for more.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s664">
   Just Good Enough
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s665">One thing that might deter you from writing Web-based applications
is the lameness of Web pages as a UI.</span>  <span class="s s666">That is a problem, I admit.</span><span class="s s667">
There were a few things we would have
   <i>
    really
   </i>
   liked to add to
HTML and HTTP.</span>  <span class="s s668">What matters, though, is that Web pages are just
good enough.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s670">There is a parallel here with the first microcomputers.</span>  <span class="s s671">The
processors in those machines weren't actually intended to be the
CPUs of computers.</span>  <span class="s s672">They were designed to be used in things like
traffic lights.</span><span class="s s673">  But guys like Ed Roberts, who designed the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">
    Altair
   </a>
   ,
realized that they were just good enough.</span>  <span class="s s674">You could combine one
of these chips with some memory (256 bytes in the first Altair),
and front panel switches, and you'd have a working computer.</span>  <span class="s s675">Being
able to have your own computer was so exciting that there were
plenty of people who wanted to buy them, however limited.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s677">Web pages weren't designed to be a UI for applications, but they're
just good enough.</span>  <span class="s s678">And for a significant number of users, software
that you can use from any browser will be enough of a win in itself
to outweigh any awkwardness in the UI.</span>  <span class="s s679">Maybe you can't write the
best-looking spreadsheet using HTML, but you can write a spreadsheet
that several people can use simultaneously from different locations
without special client software, or that can incorporate live data
feeds, or that can page you when certain conditions are triggered.</span>
<span class="s s680">More importantly, you can write new kinds of applications that
don't even have names yet.</span>  <span class="s s681">VisiCalc was not merely a microcomputer
version of a mainframe application, after all-- it was a new type
of application.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s683">
   Of course, server-based applications don't have to be Web-based.
You could have some other kind of client.  But I'm pretty sure
that's a bad idea.  It would be very convenient if you could assume
that everyone would install your client-- so convenient that you
could easily convince yourself that they all would-- but if they
don't, you're hosed.  Because Web-based software assumes nothing
about the client, it will work anywhere the Web works.  That's a
big advantage already, and the advantage will grow as new Web
devices proliferate.  Users will like you because your software
just works, and your life will be easier because you won't have to
tweak it for every new client.
   </span><!-- I would not even use Javascript,
if I were you.  Viaweb didn't. --><span class="s s684">
   [16]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s685">I feel like I've watched the evolution of the Web as closely as
anyone, and I can't predict what's going to happen with clients.</span>
<span class="s s686">Convergence is probably coming, but where?</span>  <span class="s s687">I can't pick a winner.</span>
<span class="s s688">One thing I can predict is conflict between AOL and Microsoft.</span>
<span class="s s689">Whatever Microsoft's .</span><span class="s s690">NET turns out to be, it will probably involve
connecting the desktop to servers.</span>  <span class="s s691">Unless AOL fights back, they
will either be pushed aside or turned into a pipe between Microsoft
client and server software.</span>  <span class="s s692">If Microsoft and AOL get into a client
war, the only thing sure to work on both will be browsing the Web,
meaning Web-based applications will be the only kind that work
everywhere.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s694">How will it all play out?</span>  <span class="s s695">I don't know.</span>  <span class="s s696">And you don't have to
know if you bet on Web-based applications.</span>  <span class="s s697">No one can break that
without breaking browsing.</span>  <span class="s s698">The Web may not be the only way to
deliver software, but it's one that works now and will continue to
work for a long time.</span>  <span class="s s699">Web-based applications are cheap to develop,
and easy for even the smallest startup to deliver.</span>  <span class="s s700">They're a lot
of work, and of a particularly stressful kind, but that only makes
the odds better for startups.</span>

something users love, and make more than you spend.</span>  <span class="s s718">If you get
these two right, you'll be ahead of most startups.</span>  <span class="s s719">You can figure
out the rest as you go.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s721">You may not at first make more than you spend, but as long as the
gap is closing fast enough you'll be ok.</span>  <span class="s s722">If you start out underfunded,
it will at least encourage a habit of frugality.</span>  <span class="s s723">The less you
spend, the easier it is to make more than you spend.</span>  <span class="s s724">Fortunately,
it can be very cheap to launch a Web-based application.</span>  <span class="s s725">We launched
on under $10,000, and it would be even cheaper today.</span>  <span class="s s726">We had to
spend thousands on a server, and thousands more to get SSL.</span>  <span class="s s727">(The
only company selling SSL software at the time was Netscape.</span><span class="s s728">)  Now
you can rent a much more powerful server, with SSL included, for
less than we paid for bandwidth alone.</span>  <span class="s s729">You could launch a Web-based
application now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s731">As for building something users love, here are some general tips.</span>
<span class="s s732">Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to
use yourself.</span>  <span class="s s733">Get a version 1.</span><span class="s s734">0 out fast, then continue to improve
the software, listening closely to the users as you do.</span>  <span class="s s735">The customer
is always right, but different customers are right about different
things; the least sophisticated users show you what you need to
simplify and clarify, and the most sophisticated tell you what
features you need to add.</span> <span class="s s736">The best thing software can be is easy,
but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limit
users' choices.</span>  <span class="s s737">Don't get complacent if your competitors' software
is lame; the standard to compare your software to is what it could
be, not what your current competitors happen to have.</span>  <span class="s s738">Use your
software yourself, all the time.</span>  <span class="s s739">Viaweb was supposed to be an
online store builder, but we used it to make our own site too.</span>
<span class="s s740">Don't listen to marketing people or designers or product managers
just because of their job titles.</span>  <span class="s s741">If they have good ideas, use
them, but it's up to you to decide; software has to be designed by
hackers who understand design, not designers who know a little
about software.</span>  <span class="s s742">If you can't design software as well as implement
it, don't start a startup.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s744">Now let's talk about competition.</span>  <span class="s s745">What you're afraid of is not
presumably groups of hackers like you, but actual companies, with
offices and business plans and salesmen and so on, right?</span>  <span class="s s746">Well,
they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they're right.</span>
<span class="s s747">It's a lot easier for a couple of hackers to figure out how to rent
office space or hire sales people than it is for a company of any
size to get software written.</span>  <span class="s s748">I've been on both sides, and I know.</span>
<span class="s s749">When Viaweb was bought by Yahoo, I suddenly found myself working
for a big company, and it was like trying to run through waist-deep
water.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s751">I don't mean to disparage Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s752">They had some good hackers, and
the top management were real butt-kickers.</span>  <span class="s s753">For a big company, they
were exceptional.</span>  <span class="s s754">But they were still only about a tenth as
productive as a small startup.</span>  <span class="s s755">No big company can do much better
than that.</span>  <span class="s s756">What's scary about Microsoft is that a company so
big can develop software at all.</span>  <span class="s s757">They're like a mountain that
can walk.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s759">Don't be intimidated.</span>  <span class="s s760">You can do as much that Microsoft can't as
they can do that you can't.</span>  <span class="s s761">And no one can stop you.</span>  <span class="s s762">You don't
have to ask anyone's permission to develop Web-based applications.</span>
<span class="s s763">You don't have to do licensing deals, or get shelf space in retail
stores, or grovel to have your application bundled with the OS.</span>
<span class="s s764">You can deliver software right to the browser, and no one can get
between you and potential users without preventing them from browsing
the Web.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s766">You may not believe it, but I promise you, Microsoft is scared of
you.</span>  <span class="s s767">The complacent middle managers may not be, but Bill is,
because he was you once, back in 1975, the last time a new way of
delivering software appeared.</span>

   Notes
  </span></h3>
  <p><span class="s s770">
   [1] Realizing that much of the money is in the services, companies
building lightweight clients have usually tried to combine the
hardware with an
   <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-3622600.html">
    online service
   </a>
   .</span> 
 <span class="s s771">This approach has not worked
well, partly because you need two different kinds of companies to
build consumer electronics and to run an online service, and partly
because users hate the idea.</span>  <span class="s s772">Giving away the razor and making
money on the blades may work for Gillette, but a razor is much
smaller commitment than a Web terminal.</span>  <span class="s s773">Cell phone handset makers
are satisfied to sell hardware without trying to capture the service
revenue as well.</span>  <span class="s s774">That should probably be the model for Internet
clients too.</span>  <span class="s s775">If someone just sold a nice-looking little box with
a Web browser that you could use to connect through any ISP, every
technophobe in the country would buy one.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s777">[2] Security always depends more on not screwing up than any design
decision, but the nature of server-based software will make developers
pay more attention to not screwing up.</span>  <span class="s s778">Compromising a server could
cause such damage that ASPs (that want to stay in business) are
likely to be careful about security.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s780">[3] In 1995, when we started Viaweb, Java applets were supposed to
be the technology everyone was going to use to develop server-based
applications.</span>  <span class="s s781">Applets seemed to us an old-fashioned idea.</span>  <span class="s s782">Download
programs to run on the client?</span> <span class="s s783">Simpler just to go all the way and
run the programs on the server.</span>  <span class="s s784">We wasted little time
on applets, but countless other startups must have been lured into
this tar pit.</span>  <span class="s s785">Few can have escaped alive, or Microsoft could not
have gotten away with dropping Java in the most recent version of
Explorer.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s787">[4] This point is due to Trevor Blackwell, who adds "the cost of
writing software goes up more than linearly with its size.</span>  <span class="s s788">Perhaps
this is mainly due to fixing old bugs, and the cost can be more
linear if all bugs are found quickly.</span><span class="s s789">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s791">[5] The hardest kind of bug to find may be a variant of compound
bug where one bug happens to compensate for another.</span>  <span class="s s792">When you fix
one bug, the other becomes visible.</span>  <span class="s s793">But it will seem as if the
fix is at fault, since that was the last thing you changed.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s795">[6] Within Viaweb we once had a contest to describe the worst thing
about our software.</span>  <span class="s s796">Two customer support people tied for first
prize with entries I still shiver to recall.</span>  <span class="s s797">We fixed both problems
immediately.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s799">[7] Robert Morris wrote the ordering system, which shoppers used
to place orders.</span> <span class="s s800">Trevor Blackwell wrote the image generator and
the manager, which merchants used to retrieve orders, view statistics,
and configure domain names etc.</span>  <span class="s s801">I wrote the editor, which merchants
used to build their sites.</span><span class="s s802">  The ordering system and image generator
were written in C and C++, the manager mostly in Perl, and the editor

   <span class="s s804">[8] Price discrimination is so pervasive (how often have you heard
a retailer claim that their buying power meant lower prices for
you?</span><span class="s s805">) that I was surprised to find it was outlawed in the U.</span><span class="s s806">S.</span> <span class="s s807">by
the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936.</span>  <span class="s s808">This law does not appear to be

  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s812">[10] Companies often wonder what to outsource and what not to.</span>
<span class="s s813">One possible answer: outsource any job that's not directly exposed
to competitive pressure, because outsourcing it will thereby expose
it to competitive pressure.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s815">[11] The two guys were Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.</span>  <span class="s s816">Dan wrote
a prototype in Basic in a couple days, then over the course of the
next year they worked together (mostly at night) to make a more
powerful version written in 6502 machine language.</span>  <span class="s s817">Dan was at
Harvard Business School at the time and Bob nominally had a day
job writing software.</span>  <span class="s s818">"There was no great risk in doing a business,"
Bob wrote, "If it failed it failed.</span> <span class="s s819">No big deal.</span><span class="s s820">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s822">[12] It's not quite as easy as I make it sound.</span><span class="s s823">  It took a painfully
long time for word of mouth to get going, and we did not start to
get a lot of press coverage until we hired a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.schwartz-pr.com">
    PR firm
   </a>
   (admittedly
the best in the business) for $16,000 per month.</span>  <span class="s s824">However, it was
true that the only significant channel was our own Web site.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s826">[13] If the Mac was so great, why did it lose?</span>  <span class="s s827">Cost, again.</span>
<span class="s s828">Microsoft concentrated on the software business, and unleashed a
swarm of cheap component suppliers on Apple hardware.</span>  <span class="s s829">It did not
help, either, that suits took over during a critical period.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s831">[14] One thing that would help Web-based applications, and help
keep the next generation of software from being overshadowed by
Microsoft, would be a good open-source browser.</span>  <span class="s s832">Mozilla is
open-source but seems to have suffered from having been corporate
software for so long.</span>  <span class="s s833">A small, fast browser that was actively
maintained would be a great thing in itself, and would probably
also encourage companies to build little Web appliances.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s835">Among other things, a proper open-source browser would cause HTTP
and HTML to continue to evolve (as e.</span><span class="s s836">g.</span> <span class="s s837">Perl has).</span>  <span class="s s838">It would help
Web-based applications greatly to be able to distinguish between
selecting a link and following it; all you'd need to do this would
be a trivial enhancement of HTTP, to allow multiple urls in a
request.</span>  <span class="s s839">Cascading menus would also be good.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s841">If you want to change the world, write a new Mosaic.</span>  <span class="s s842">Think it's
too late?</span>  <span class="s s843">In 1998 a lot of people thought it was too late to launch
a new search engine, but Google proved them wrong.</span>  <span class="s s844">There is always
room for something new if the current options suck enough.</span>  <span class="s s845">Make
sure it works on all the free OSes first-- new things start with
their users.</span>

personal experience than anyone, writes:

   <span class="s s848">"I would go farther in saying that because server-based software
is so hard on the programmers, it causes a fundamental economic
shift away from large companies.</span> <span class="s s849">It requires the kind of intensity
and dedication from programmers that they will only be willing to
provide when it's their own company.</span>  <span class="s s850">Software companies can hire
skilled people to work in a not-too-demanding environment, and can
hire unskilled people to endure hardships, but they can't hire
highly skilled people to bust their asses.</span> <span class="s s851">Since capital is no
longer needed, big companies have little to bring to the table.</span><span class="s s852">"</span>

   [16] In the original version of this essay, I advised avoiding
Javascript.  That was a good plan in 2001, but Javascript now works.
   </span><!-- Most of the Javascript I see on the Web isn't necessary, and
much of it breaks.  (My mental picture of a Javascript programmer
is Wally from Dilbert, with a thought bubble over his head reading
"It works on my computer.") Yahoo uses Javascript in a few places,
though not many.  I once asked someone there how this worked out,
and he said "they ended up learning a <i>lot</i> about different browser
versions." Microsoft may start to embrace and extend Javascript,
or even can it, like Java.  And when you start to be able to browse
actual Web pages on your cell phone or PDA (or toaster), who knows
if they'll even support it? -->
