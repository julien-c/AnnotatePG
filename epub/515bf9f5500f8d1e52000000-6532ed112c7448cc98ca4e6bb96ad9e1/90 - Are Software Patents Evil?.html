    (This essay is derived from a talk at Google.)
   </i>
  </span></p>
  <p><span class="s s4">
   A few weeks ago I found to my surprise that I'd been granted four
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/morepatents">
    patents
   </a>
   .</span>  
<span class="s s5">This was all the more surprising
because I'd only applied for three.</span>  <span class="s s6">The patents aren't mine, of
course.</span>  <span class="s s7">They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo's when they
bought us.</span>  <span class="s s8">But the news set me thinking about the question of
software patents generally.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">Patents are a hard problem.</span>  <span class="s s11">I've had to advise most of the startups
we've funded about them, and despite years of experience I'm still
not always sure I'm giving the right advice.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you're against
software patents, you're against patents in general.</span>  <span class="s s14">Gradually our
machines consist more and more of software.</span>  <span class="s s15">Things that used to
be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and
trees and closures.</span>  <span class="s s16">There's nothing special about physical embodiments
of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software
equivalent not.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s18">Unfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point.</span>  <span class="s s19">Patent
law in most countries says that algorithms aren't patentable.</span>  <span class="s s20">This
rule is left over from a time when "algorithm" meant something like
the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</span>  <span class="s s21">In 1800, people could not see as readily
as we can that a great many patents on mechanical objects were
really patents on the algorithms they embodied.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s23">Patent lawyers still have to pretend that's what they're doing when
they patent algorithms.  You must not use the word "algorithm" in
the title of a patent application, just as you must not use the
word "essays" in the title of a book.</span>  <span class="s s24">If you want to patent an
algorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm.</span>
<span class="s s25">Then it's mechanical; phew.</span>  <span class="s s26">The default euphemism for algorithm
is "system and method.</span><span class="s s27">"</span>  <span class="s s28">Try a patent search for that phrase and
see how many results you get.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s30">Since software patents are no different from hardware patents,
people who say "software patents are evil" are saying simply "patents
are evil.</span><span class="s s31">"</span>  <span class="s s32">So why do so many people complain about software patents
specifically?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s34">I think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept
of software patents.</span>  <span class="s s35">Whenever software meets government, bad things
happen, because software changes fast and government changes slow.</span>
<span class="s s36">The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and the
novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they've
made a lot of mistakes.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s38">The most common is to grant patents that shouldn't be granted.</span>  <span class="s s39">To
be patentable, an invention has to be more than new.</span>  <span class="s s40">It also has
to be non-obvious.</span>  <span class="s s41">And this, especially, is where the USPTO has
been dropping the ball.</span> <span class="s s42">Slashdot has an icon that expresses the
problem vividly: a knife and fork with the words "patent pending"
superimposed.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s44">
   The scary thing is, this is the
   <i>
    only
   </i>
   icon they have for
patent stories.</span>  <span class="s s45">Slashdot readers now take it for granted that a
story about a patent will be about a bogus patent.</span>
<span class="s s46">That's how bad the problem has become.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s48">The problem with Amazon's notorious one-click patent, for example,
is not that it's a software patent, but that it's obvious.</span>  <span class="s s49">Any
online store that kept people's shipping addresses would have
implemented this.</span>  <span class="s s50">The reason Amazon did it first was not that they
were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest
sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they
could buy something.</span><span class="s s51">
                           
                            [
   <a name="f1" href="#f1n">
    1
   </a>
   ]
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives
and forks of our world.</span>  <span class="s s53">The problem is, the USPTO are not hackers.</span>
<span class="s s54">They're probably good at judging new inventions for casting steel
or grinding lenses, but they don't understand software yet.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s56">At this point an optimist would be tempted to add "but they will
eventually.</span><span class="s s57">"</span>  <span class="s s58">Unfortunately that might not be true.</span>  <span class="s s59">The problem
with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the
patent office takes a while to understand new technology.</span>  <span class="s s60">If so,
this problem will only get worse, because the rate of technological
change seems to be increasing.</span>  <span class="s s61">In thirty years, the patent office
may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but
there will be other new types of inventions they understand even
less.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s63">Applying for a patent is a negotiation.</span>  <span class="s s64">You generally apply for a
broader patent than you think you'll be granted, and the examiners
reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting others.</span>  <span class="s s65">So
I don't really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent.</span>
<span class="s s66">The big mistake was the patent office's, for not insisting on
something narrower, with real technical content.</span>  <span class="s s67">By granting such
an over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on the
first date.</span>  <span class="s s68">Was Amazon supposed to say no?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s70">Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the
patent, but in enforcing it.</span>  <span class="s s71">A lot of companies (Microsoft, for
example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broad
patents,  but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes.</span>  <span class="s s72">Like
nuclear weapons, the main role of big companies' patent portfolios
is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit.</span>  <span class="s s73">Amazon's
suit against Barnes &amp; Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear
first strike.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s75">That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them.</span>  <span class="s s76">Barnes &amp;
Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway.</span>  <span class="s s77">To
attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting black
mark on their own reputation.</span>  <span class="s s78">Even now I think if you asked hackers
to free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up
in the first ten topics.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s80">Google clearly doesn't feel that merely holding patents is evil.</span>
<span class="s s81">They've applied for a lot of them.</span>  <span class="s s82">Are they hypocrites?</span>  <span class="s s83">Are patents
evil?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s85">There are really two variants of that question, and people answering
it often aren't clear in their own minds which they're answering.</span>
<span class="s s86">There's a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal system,
to apply for patents?</span> <span class="s s87">and also a broader one: is it bad that the
current legal system allows patents?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s89">These are separate questions.</span>  <span class="s s90">For example, in preindustrial societies
like medieval Europe, when someone attacked you, you didn't call
the police.</span>  <span class="s s91">There were no police.</span>  <span class="s s92">When attacked, you were supposed
to fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it.</span>  <span class="s s93">Was
this wrong?</span>  <span class="s s94">That's two questions: was it wrong to take justice
into your own hands, and was it wrong that you had to?</span>  <span class="s s95">We tend to
say yes to the second, but no to the first.</span>  <span class="s s96">If no one else will
defend you, you have to defend yourself.</span><span class="s s97">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s98">The situation with patents is similar.</span>  <span class="s s99">Business is a kind of
ritualized warfare.</span>  <span class="s s100">Indeed, it evolved from actual warfare: most
early traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates depending
on how strong you seemed.</span>  <span class="s s101">In business there are certain rules
describing how companies may and may not compete with one another,
and someone deciding that they're going to play by their own rules
is missing the point.</span>  <span class="s s102">Saying "I'm not going to apply for patents
just because everyone else does" is not like saying "I'm not going
to lie just because everyone else does.</span><span class="s s103">"</span>  <span class="s s104">It's more like saying
"I'm not going to use TCP/IP just because everyone else does.</span><span class="s s105">"</span> <span class="s s106">Oh
yes you are.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s108">
   A closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for the
first time, realizing with shock that the players were
   <i>
    deliberately
   </i>
   bumping into one another, and deciding that one would on no account
be so rude when playing hockey oneself.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s110">Hockey allows checking.</span>  <span class="s s111">It's part of the game.</span>  <span class="s s112">If your team refuses
to do it, you simply lose.</span>  <span class="s s113">So it is in business.</span>  <span class="s s114">Under the present
rules, patents are part of the game.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s116">What does that mean in practice?</span>  <span class="s s117">We tell the startups we fund not
to worry about infringing patents, because startups rarely get sued
for patent infringement.</span>  <span class="s s118">There are only two reasons someone might
sue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them.</span>
<span class="s s119">Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money.</span> <span class="s s120">And in practice
they don't seem to get sued much by competitors, either.</span>  <span class="s s121">They don't
get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensive
distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they
are, their patents probably haven't issued yet.</span><span class="s s122">
                                                   
                                                    [

   </a>
   ]
                                                   
                                                   Nor do startups,
at least in the software business, seem to get sued much by established
competitors.</span>  <span class="s s123">Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don't know
of an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement.</span>
<span class="s s124">Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don't win by winning lawsuits.</span>
<span class="s s125">That's too uncertain.</span>  <span class="s s126">They win by locking competitors out of their
sales channels.</span>  <span class="s s127">If you do manage to threaten them, they're more
likely to buy you than sue you.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s129">When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller
ones, it's usually a big company on the way down, grasping at
straws.</span>  <span class="s s130">For example, Unisys's attempts to enforce their patent on
LZW compression.</span>  <span class="s s131">When you see a big company threatening patent
suits, sell.</span>  <span class="s s132">When a company starts fighting over IP, it's a sign
they've lost the real battle, for users.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s134">A company that sues competitors for patent infringement is like
a defender who has been beaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead
with the referee.</span>  <span class="s s135">You don't do that if you can still reach the
ball, even if you genuinely believe you've been fouled.</span><span class="s s136">  So a company
threatening patent suits is a company in
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/15/azul_sues_sun/">
    trouble
   </a>
   .</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s138">When we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commerce
business was granted a patent on online ordering, or something like
that.</span>  <span class="s s139">I got a call from a VP there asking if we'd like to license
it.</span>  <span class="s s140">I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, and
would never hold up in court.</span>  <span class="s s141">"Ok," he replied.</span>  <span class="s s142">"So, are you guys
hiring?</span><span class="s s143">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s145">If your startup grows big enough, however, you'll start to get sued,
no matter what you do.</span>  <span class="s s146">If you go public, for example, you'll be
sued by multiple patent trolls who hope you'll pay them off to go
away.</span>  <span class="s s147">More on them later.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s149">In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till
you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether
they have grounds to or not.</span>  <span class="s s150">So I advise fatalism.</span>  <span class="s s151">Don't waste
your time worrying about patent infringement.</span>  <span class="s s152">You're probably
violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces.</span>  <span class="s s153">At the start,
at least, just worry about making something great and getting lots
of users.</span>  <span class="s s154">If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth
attacking, you're doing well.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s156">We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not
so they can sue competitors.</span>  <span class="s s157">Successful startups either get bought
or grow into big companies.</span>  <span class="s s158">If a startup wants to grow into a big
company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent
portfolio they'll need to maintain an armed truce with other big
companies.</span>  <span class="s s159">If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents
because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s161">Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirers
care about patents.</span>  <span class="s s162">Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy
decision for the acquirer.</span>  <span class="s s163">Should we buy this little startup or
build our own?</span>  <span class="s s164">And two things, especially, make them decide not
to build their own: if you already have a large and rapidly growing
user base, and if you have a fairly solid patent application on
critical parts of your software.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s166">There's a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building:
that if they built their own, they'd screw it up.</span>  <span class="s s167">But few big
companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves.</span>  <span class="s s168">It's
usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would
be for the company to build their own, and they overestimate their
abilities.</span><span class="s s169">
                                                                   
                                                                    [

                                                                   A patent seems to change the balance.</span>  <span class="s s170">It gives the
acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn't copy what you're doing.</span>
<span class="s s171">It may also help them to grasp what's special about your technology.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s173">Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the
software business.</span>  <span class="s s174">It's kind of ironic, considering all the dire
things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but
when one looks closely at the software business, the most striking
thing is how little patents seem to matter.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s176">In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent
infringement.</span>  <span class="s s177">For example, the airport baggage scanning business
was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies,
InVision and L-3.</span>  <span class="s s178">In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with
new technology that let them build scanners a third the size.</span>  <span class="s s179">They
were sued for patent infringement before they'd even released a
product.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s181">You rarely hear that kind of story in our world.</span>  <span class="s s182">The one example
I've found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patent
suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005.</span>  <span class="s s183">Xfire doesn't
seem to be a very big deal, and it's hard to say why Yahoo felt
threatened.</span>  <span class="s s184">Xfire's VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar
stuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo
sued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it.</span>  <span class="s s185">My
guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed.</span>  <span class="s s186">At any rate they didn't
pursue the suit very vigorously.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s188">
   Why do patents play so small a role in software?  I can think of
three possible reasons.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s189">One is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves
are not worth very much.</span>  <span class="s s190">I may be maligning other fields here, but
it seems that in most types of engineering you can hand the details
of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and
get the desired result.</span>  <span class="s s191">For example, if someone develops a new
process for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemble
a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they'll be able
to get the same yield.</span>  <span class="s s192">This doesn't seem to work in software.</span>
<span class="s s193">Software is so subtle and unpredictable that "qualified experts"
don't get you very far.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s195">That's why we rarely hear phrases like "qualified expert" in the
software business.</span>  <span class="s s196">What that level of ability can get you is, say,
to make your software compatible with some other piece of software--
in eight months, at enormous cost.</span>  <span class="s s197">To do anything harder you need
individual brilliance.</span>  <span class="s s198">If you assemble a team of qualified experts
and tell them to make a new web-based email program, they'll get
their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds.</span>
  </p>

   Experts can implement, but they can't

    design

<span class="s s201">Or rather, expertise in implementation is the only kind most people,

  <p>
   <span class="s s203">But design is a definite skill.</span>  <span class="s s204">It's not just an airy intangible.</span>
<span class="s s205">Things always seem intangible when you don't understand them.</span>
<span class="s s206">Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800.</span>  <span class="s s207">Who
knew there was so much to know about it?</span>  <span class="s s208">So it is with design.</span>
<span class="s s209">Some people are good at it and some people are bad at it, and there's
something very tangible they're good or bad at.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s211">The reason design counts so much in software is probably that there
are fewer constraints than on physical things.</span>  <span class="s s212">Building physical
things is expensive and dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s213">The space of possible choices
is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; and
you're subject to a lot of regulations.</span>  <span class="s s214">You don't have any of that
if you and a couple friends decide to create a new web-based
application.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s216">Because there's so much scope for design in software, a successful
application tends to be way more than the sum of its patents.</span>  <span class="s s217">What
protects little companies from being copied by bigger competitors
is not just their patents, but the thousand little things the big
company will get wrong if they try.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s219">The second reason patents don't count for much in our world is that
startups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did.</span>

pretty frequently on this route.</span>

   <span class="s s225">Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial.</span>
<span class="s s226">If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they'll
meet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot.</span>  <span class="s s227">To
sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often
means seeing something the big company doesn't want to see.</span>  <span class="s s228">IBM
used to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn't
bother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn't
want to see the threat it posed.</span>  <span class="s s229">Companies building web based apps
are similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn't want
to imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant.</span>

   <span class="s s231">The third reason patents don't seem to matter very much in software
is public opinion-- or rather, hacker opinion.</span><span class="s s232">  In a recent
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.computing.co.uk/forbes/news/2152720/interview-steve-ballmer-linux">
    interview
   </a>
   ,
Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of attacking Linux
on patent grounds.</span>  <span class="s s233">But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid.</span>
<span class="s s234">They'd face the mother of all boycotts.</span>  <span class="s s235">And not just from the
technical community in general; a lot of their own people would
rebel.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s237">Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are
highly mobile.</span>  <span class="s s238">If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won't
work there.</span>  <span class="s s239">For some reason this seems to be more true in software
than other businesses.</span>  <span class="s s240">I don't think it's because hackers have
intrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills are
easily transferrable.</span>  <span class="s s241">Perhaps we can split the difference and say
that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s243">Google's "don't be evil" policy may for this reason be the most
valuable thing they've discovered.</span>  <span class="s s244">It's very constraining in some
ways.</span>  <span class="s s245">If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whacked
for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy.</span>  <span class="s s246">But
I think it's worth it.</span>  <span class="s s247">It helps them to hire the best people, and
it's better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to be
constrained by principles than by stupidity.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s249">
   (I wish someone would get this point across to the present
administration.)
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s250">I'm not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three
ingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be not
to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and too
poor to sue one another.</span>  <span class="s s251">So despite the huge number of software
patents there's not a lot of suing going on.</span>  <span class="s s252">With one exception:
patent trolls.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s254">Patent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose whole
business is to accumulate patents and threaten to sue companies who
actually make things.</span>  <span class="s s255">Patent trolls, it seems safe to say, are
evil.</span>  <span class="s s256">I feel a bit stupid saying that, because when you're saying
something that Richard Stallman and Bill Gates would both agree
with, you must be perilously close to tautologies.</span>

way.</span>  <span class="s s263">In the period just before the industrial revolution, some of
the greatest fortunes in countries like England and France were
made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crown--
like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk-- and then
used this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business.</span>  <span class="s s264">So
when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they're more right
than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad
specifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s266">Patent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise.</span>  <span class="s s267">In
the last couple years they've extracted hundreds of millions of
dollars from them.</span>  <span class="s s268">Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely because
they create nothing.</span>  <span class="s s269">Big companies are safe from being sued by
other big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit.</span>  <span class="s s270">But
because patent trolls don't make anything, there's nothing they can
be sued for.</span>  <span class="s s271">I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly,
at least by legal standards.</span>  <span class="s s272">It's clearly an abuse of the system,
and the victims are powerful.</span><span class="s s273">

  <p>
   <span class="s s274">But evil as patent trolls are, I don't think they hamper innovation
much.</span>  <span class="s s275">They don't sue till a startup has made money, and by that
point the innovation that generated it has already happened.</span>  <span class="s s276">I
can't think of a startup that avoided working on some problem because
of patent trolls.</span>

  <p>
   <span class="s s278">So much for hockey as the game is played now.</span>  <span class="s s279">What about the more
theoretical question of whether hockey would be a better game without
checking?</span>  <span class="s s280">Do patents encourage or discourage innovation?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s282">This is a very hard question to answer in the general case.</span>  <span class="s s283">People
write whole books on the topic.</span>  <span class="s s284">One of my main hobbies is the
history of technology, and even though I've studied the subject for
years, it would take me several weeks of research to be able to say
whether patents have in general been a net win.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s286">One thing I can say is that 99.</span><span class="s s287">9% of the people who express opinions
on the subject do it not based on such research, but out of a kind
of religious conviction.</span>  <span class="s s288">At least, that's the polite way of putting
it; the colloquial version involves speech coming out of organs not
designed for that purpose.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s290">Whether they encourage innovation or not, patents were at least
intended to.</span>  <span class="s s291">You don't get a patent for nothing.</span><span class="s s292">  In return for
the exclusive right to use an idea, you have to
   <i>
    publish
   </i>
   it,
and it was largely to encourage such openness that patents were
established.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s294">Before patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret.</span>  <span class="s s295">With
patents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyone
your idea, we'll protect it for you.</span>  <span class="s s296">There is a parallel here to
the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time.</span>
<span class="s s297">Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order,
rich people had private armies.</span>  <span class="s s298">As governments got more powerful,
they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility for
protecting them.</span>  <span class="s s299">(Magnates still have bodyguards, but no longer
to protect them from other magnates.</span><span class="s s300">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s301">Patents, like police, are involved in many abuses.</span>  <span class="s s302">But in both
cases the default is something worse.</span> <span class="s s303">The choice is not "patents
or freedom?</span><span class="s s304">"</span> <span class="s s305">any more than it is "police or freedom?</span><span class="s s306">"</span> <span class="s s307">The actual
questions are respectively "patents or secrecy?</span><span class="s s308">"</span> <span class="s s309">and "police or
gangs?</span><span class="s s310">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s312">As with gangs, we have some idea what secrecy would be like, because
that's how things used to be.</span>  <span class="s s313">The economy of medieval Europe was
divided up into little tribes, each jealously guarding their
privileges and secrets.</span>  <span class="s s314">In Shakespeare's time, "mystery" was
synonymous with "craft.</span><span class="s s315">"</span>   <span class="s s316">Even today we can see an echo of the
secrecy of medieval guilds, in the now pointless secrecy of the
Masons.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s318">The most memorable example of medieval industrial secrecy is probably
Venice, which forbade glassblowers to leave the city, and sent
assassins after those who tried.</span><span class="s s319">  We might like to think we wouldn't
go so far, but the movie industry has already tried to pass
   <a target="_blank" href="http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5106684.html">
    laws
   </a>
   prescribing three year prison terms just for putting movies on
public networks.</span>  <span class="s s320">Want to try a frightening thought experiment?</span> <span class="s s321">If
the movie industry could have any law they wanted, where would they
stop?</span>  <span class="s s322">Short of the death penalty, one assumes, but how close would
they get?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s324">Even worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decrease
in efficiency that would accompany increased secrecy.</span>  <span class="s s325">As anyone
who has dealt with organizations that operate on a "need to know"
basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells is
terribly inefficient.</span><span class="s s326">  The flaw in the "need to know" principle is
that you don't
   <i>
    know
   </i>
   who needs to know something.</span>  <span class="s s327">An idea
from one area might spark a great discovery in another.</span>  <span class="s s328">But the
discoverer doesn't know he needs to know it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s330">If secrecy were the only protection for ideas, companies wouldn't
just have to be secretive with other companies; they'd have to be
secretive internally.</span>  <span class="s s331">This would encourage what is already the
worst trait of big companies.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s333">I'm not saying secrecy would be worse than patents, just that we
couldn't discard patents for free.</span>  <span class="s s334">Businesses would become more
secretive to compensate, and in some fields this might get ugly.</span>
<span class="s s335">Nor am I defending the current patent system.</span>  <span class="s s336">There is clearly a
lot that's broken about it.</span>   <span class="s s337">But the breakage seems to affect
software less than most other fields.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s339">In the software business I know from experience whether patents
encourage or discourage innovation, and the answer is the type that
people who like to argue about public policy least like to hear:
they don't affect innovation much, one way or the other.</span>  <span class="s s340">Most
innovation in the software business happens in startups, and startups
should simply ignore other companies' patents.</span>  <span class="s s341">At least, that's
what we advise, and we bet money on that advice.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s343">The only real role of patents, for most startups, is as an element
of the mating dance with acquirers.</span>  <span class="s s344">There patents do help a little.</span>
<span class="s s345">And so they do encourage innovation indirectly, in that they give
more power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the most
innovation happens.</span>  <span class="s s346">But even in the mating dance, patents are of
secondary importance.</span>  <span class="s s347">It matters more to make something great and
get a lot of users.</span>
