   <span class="s s3">When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is
to seem extra friendly.</span>  <span class="s s4">You smile and say "pleased to meet you,"
whether you are or not.</span>  <span class="s s5">There's nothing dishonest about this.</span>
<span class="s s6">Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant
to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that 
"Can you pass the salt?</span><span class="s s7">"</span> <span class="s s8">is only grammatically a question.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">I'm perfectly willing to smile and say "pleased to meet you"
when meeting new people.</span>  <span class="s s11">But there is another set of 
customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so
harmless.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s13">The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print
is that most essays are written to persuade.</span>
<span class="s s14">And as any politician could tell
you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the
facts.</span>  <span class="s s15">You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine
go down.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of 
a government program will not merely say "The
program is canceled.</span><span class="s s18">"</span> <span class="s s19">That would seem offensively
curt.</span>  <span class="s s20">Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the
noble effort made by the people who worked on it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they
interact with the ideas.</span>  <span class="s s23">Saying "pleased to meet you" is just
something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin 
added by politicians is woven through it.</span>  <span class="s s24">We're starting to
move from social lies to real lies.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s26">
   Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/unions.html">
    labor unions
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s27">As written,
it tends to offend people who like unions.</span>
   </p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s29">People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic
  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking
  now?</span>  <span class="s s30">The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation
  of people living in fallen civilizations.</span> <span class="s s31">Our ancestors were
  giants.</span>  <span class="s s32">The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
  a moral courage that's lacking today.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s34">
   Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of
offending them:
   </span><blockquote>
    <span class="s s35">Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions
  for workers.</span>  <span class="s s36">But though
  labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union
  leaders are any less courageous.</span>  <span class="s s37">An employer couldn't get away
  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they
  did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink
  from the challenge.</span>  <span class="s s38">So I think it would be a mistake to attribute
  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who
  run them.</span>  <span class="s s39">Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we
  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because
  present union leaders are somehow inferior.</span>  <span class="s s40">The cause must be
  external.</span><span class="s s41">

    </a>
    ]
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s42">
   It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal
qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,
but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day
union leaders would have to be inferior people.  But written this
way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather
than an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive to
people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s43">I believe everything I wrote in the second version.</span>  <span class="s s44">Early union
leaders did make heroic sacrifices.</span>   <span class="s s45">And
present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if
necessary.</span>  <span class="s s46">People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of "the
greatest generation.</span><span class="s s47">"</span><span class="s s48">

  </span></p>
  <p><span class="s s49">
   If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I
write it that way?  Why offend people needlessly?
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s50">Because I'd rather offend people than pander to them, 
and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other.</span>  <span class="s s51">The degree of
courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all
that matters for the argument is that they're the same.</span>
<span class="s s52">But if you want to please
people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth.</span>  <span class="s s53">You're
always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their
misconceptions from bumping against reality.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s55">Most writers do.</span>  <span class="s s56">Most writers write to persuade, if only out of
habit or politeness.</span>  <span class="s s57">But I don't write to persuade; I write to
figure out.</span>  <span class="s s58">I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased
reader.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s60">Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone
who doesn't will seem arrogant.</span>  <span class="s s61">In fact, worse than arrogant: since
readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay
that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander
to the other.</span>  <span class="s s62">To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph
sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host
would say to stir up his followers.</span>  <span class="s s63">But it's not.</span>  <span class="s s64">Something that
curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a
partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same
place they come from different sources.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s66">Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel
better?</span>  <span class="s s67">Maybe not.</span>  <span class="s s68">Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness.</span><span class="s s69">
I write
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/power.html">
    code
   </a>
   the same way I write essays, 
making pass after pass
looking for anything I can cut.</span>  <span class="s s70">But I have a legitimate reason for
doing this.</span>  <span class="s s71">You don't know what the ideas are until you get them
down to the fewest words.</span><span class="s s72">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s73">The danger of the second paragraph
is not merely that it's longer.</span>  <span class="s s74">It's that you start to lie to
yourself.</span>  <span class="s s75">The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin
you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s77">
   I think the goal of an essay should be to discover
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">
    surprising
   </a>
   things.</span>  <span class="s s78">That's my goal, at least.</span>
<span class="s s79">And most surprising means most different from what people currently
believe.</span>  <span class="s s80">So writing to persuade and writing to discover are
diametrically opposed.</span>  <span class="s s81">The more your conclusions disagree with
readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on
selling your ideas rather than having them.</span>  <span class="s s82">As you accelerate,
this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%
of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any
faster.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s84">It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having
to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's.</span>
<span class="s s85">I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously
from ideas I knew would be hard to sell.</span>  <span class="s s86">When I notice something
surprising, it's usually very faint at first.</span>  <span class="s s87">There's nothing more
than a slight stirring of discomfort.</span>  <span class="s s88">I don't want anything to get
in the way of noticing it consciously.</span>

I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing
this.</span>  <span class="s s92">To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious
crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction.</span>
<span class="s s93">The solution was a kind of method acting.</span>  <span class="s s94">It was revoltingly
familiar to slip back into it.</span>

Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately
pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words:
I switch person.</span>  <span class="s s98">This flattering distinction seems so natural to
the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I
switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done
as conspicuously as this.</span>

he writes about controversial things.</span>
