    <!--<i>(I wrote this essay immediately after the election.
But after writing it I buried it; I was so
depressed about the election that I just didn't want to think
about it anymore.
I recently came across this essay again, and it
strikes me as on the mark.)</i>
--><span class="s s3">
    A lot of people are writing now about 
why Kerry lost.  Here I want to
examine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so 
wrong?
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s4">In Ohio, which Kerry ultimately
lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory.</span>  <span class="s s5">And this wasn't just
random error.</span>  <span class="s s6">In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote.</span>
<span class="s s7">In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted
a dead heat.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">(These are not early numbers.</span> <span class="s s10">They're from about midnight eastern time, 
long after polls closed in Ohio and Florida.</span>  <span class="s s11">And yet by the
next afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns.</span>  
<span class="s s12">The only way I can imagine this happening is if those in
charge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actual
returns.</span>  <span class="s s13">But that's another issue.</span><span class="s s14">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">What happened?</span>  <span class="s s16">The source of the problem may be a variant of
the Bradley Effect.</span>  
<span class="s s17">This term
was invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, 
lost an election for governor of California despite a comfortable
lead in the polls.</span>  <span class="s s18">Apparently voters were afraid to say  
they planned to vote against him, lest their motives be
(perhaps correctly) suspected.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">It seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year.</span>
<span class="s s21">In theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.</span>  
<span class="s s22">You're not asking people what they would do.</span>  <span class="s s23">You're
asking what they just did.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">How can you get errors asking that?</span>  <span class="s s26">Because some people don't
respond.</span>  <span class="s s27">To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every
20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.</span>  <span class="s s28">But not
everyone wants to answer.</span>  <span class="s s29">And the pollsters can't simply ignore
those who won't, or their sample isn't random anymore.</span>  <span class="s s30">So what
they do, apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of the
person, and guess from that who they voted for.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s32">
    This works so long as there is no
    <i>
     correlation
    </i>
    between who people
vote for and whether they're willing to talk about it.</span>  <span class="s s33">But this
year there may have been.</span>  <span class="s s34">It may be that a significant number of 
those who voted for
Bush didn't want to say so.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s36">Why not?</span>  <span class="s s37">Because people in the US are more conservative than they're
willing to admit.</span>  <span class="s s38">The values of the elite in this country, at least
at the moment, are NPR values.</span>  <span class="s s39">The average person, as I think both
Republicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative.</span>  
<span class="s s40">But while some openly flaunt the fact that they don't share the
opinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous about it, as 
if they had bad table manners.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s42">
    For example, according to current NPR values, you
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/say.html">
     can't say
    </a>
    anything that might be 
perceived as disparaging towards homosexuals.</span>  <span class="s s43">To do  
so is "homophobic.</span><span class="s s44">"</span>  <span class="s s45">And yet a large number of Americans are deeply
religious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject of
homosexuality.</span>  <span class="s s46">What are they to do?</span>  <span class="s s47">I think what many do is keep 
their opinions, but keep them to themselves.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s49">They know what they believe, but they also know what they're supposed
to believe.</span>
<span class="s s50">And so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks
them their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not
always say what they really think.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s52">When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to
underestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters.</span>  <span class="s s53">This seems
to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so 
far off this year.</span>  <span class="s s54">NPR values   
said one ought to vote for Kerry.</span>  <span class="s s55">So all the people who voted for
Kerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters
they had.</span> <span class="s s56">No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet
defiance.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- Imagine this scenario.  A husband and wife go to vote.  The wife
thinks Bush has made a mess in Iraq and that the family is worse   
off economically than a few years ago, and plans to vote for Kerry.
The husband thinks it's
great that America is finally kicking some ass, and sees in George
Bush a kind of cowboy figure that he likes to identify with.  Which
of the two is more likely to want to explain to a pollster why they
voted as they did?-->
