   <h1><span class="s s1">
    The Word "Hacker"
   </span></h1>
   </h2><p><span class="s s2">
    April 2004
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">To the popular press, "hacker" means someone who breaks
into computers.</span>  <span class="s s4">Among programmers it means a good programmer.</span>
<span class="s s5">But the two meanings are connected.</span>  <span class="s s6">To programmers,
"hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone
who can make a computer do what he wants&acirc;&#128;&#148;whether the computer
wants to or not.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">To add to the confusion, the noun "hack" also has two senses.</span>  <span class="s s9">It can
be either a compliment or an insult.</span>  <span class="s s10">It's called a hack when
you do something in an ugly way.</span>  <span class="s s11">But when you do something
so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also
called a hack.</span>  <span class="s s12">The word is used more often in the former than
the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more
common than brilliant ones.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s14">Believe it or not, the two senses of "hack" are also
connected.</span>  <span class="s s15">Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in
common: they both break the rules.</span>  <span class="s s16">And there is a gradual
continuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using
duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking
that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s18">Hacking predates computers.</span>  <span class="s s19">When he
was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to
amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.</span>
<span class="s s20">This tradition continues today.</span>
<span class="s s21">When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much
time around MIT had
his own lock picking kit.</span>
<span class="s s22">(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.</span><span class="s s23">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s24">It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would
want to do such things.</span>
<span class="s s25">Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for
breaking into computers.</span>  <span class="s s26">This had only recently been declared
a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative
technique didn't work.</span>  <span class="s s27">Police investigation apparently begins with
a motive.</span>  <span class="s s28">The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,
revenge.</span>  <span class="s s29">Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on
the FBI's list.</span>  <span class="s s30">Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to
them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s32">Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers'
general attitude of disobedience.</span>  <span class="s s33">But that disobedience is
a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.</span>
<span class="s s34">They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate
newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them
a certain problem can't be solved.</span>
<span class="s s35">Suppress one, and you suppress the other.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s37">This attitude is sometimes affected.</span>  <span class="s s38">Sometimes young programmers
notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to
adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.</span>
<span class="s s39">The fake version is not merely
annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers
can actually slow the process of innovation.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s41">But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,
the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win.</span>  <span class="s s42">I wish its
advantages were better understood.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s44">For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are
simply mystified by
hackers' attitudes toward copyrights.</span>  <span class="s s45">They are a perennial
topic of heated discussion on Slashdot.</span>
<span class="s s46">But why should people who program computers
be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s48">
    Partly because some companies use
    <i>
     mechanisms
    </i>
    to prevent
copying.</span>  <span class="s s49">Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is
how to pick it.</span>  <span class="s s50">But there is a deeper reason that
hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.</span>
<span class="s s51">They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect
"intellectual property"
as a threat to the intellectual
freedom they need to do their job.</span>
<span class="s s52">And they are right.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">It is by poking about inside current technology that
hackers get ideas for the next generation.</span>  <span class="s s55">No thanks,
intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any
outside help.</span>  <span class="s s56">But they're wrong.</span>
<span class="s s57">The next generation of computer technology has
often&acirc;&#128;&#148;perhaps more often than not&acirc;&#128;&#148;been developed by outsiders.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing
what they expected to be
the next generation of business computer.</span>  <span class="s s60">They were mistaken.</span><span class="s s61">
The next generation of business computer was
being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired
guys called Steve in a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/garage.html">
     garage
    </a>
    in Los Altos.</span>  <span class="s s62">At about the
same time, the powers that be
were cooperating to develop the
official next generation operating system, Multics.</span>
<span class="s s63">But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off
and wrote their own.</span>  <span class="s s64">They gave it a name that
was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s66">The latest intellectual property laws impose
unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that
leads to new ideas.</span> <span class="s s67">In the past, a competitor might use patents
to prevent you from selling a copy of something they
made, but they couldn't prevent you from
taking one apart to see how it worked.</span>   <span class="s s68">The latest
laws make this a crime.</span>  <span class="s s69">How are we
to develop new technology if we can't study current
technology to figure out how to improve it?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s71">Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.</span>
<span class="s s72">Computers are responsible for the problem.</span>  <span class="s s73">The control systems
inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.
Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is
in software.</span> <span class="s s74">And by this I mean software in the general sense:
i.</span><span class="s s75">e.</span> <span class="s s76">data.</span>  <span class="s s77">A song on an LP is physically stamped into the
plastic.</span>  <span class="s s78">A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s80">Data is by definition easy to copy.</span>  <span class="s s81">And the Internet
makes copies easy to distribute.</span>  <span class="s s82">So it is no wonder
companies are afraid.</span>  <span class="s s83">But, as so often happens, fear has
clouded their judgement.</span>  <span class="s s84">The government has responded
with draconian laws to protect intellectual property.</span>
<span class="s s85">They probably mean well.</span> <span class="s s86">But
they may not realize that such laws will do more harm
than good.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s88">Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?</span>
<span class="s s89">If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this
mystery&acirc;&#128;&#148;for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly
heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,
I'd want to go out and investigate.</span>  <span class="s s90">Hackers are not stupid,
and unanimity is very rare in this world.</span>
<span class="s s91">So if they're all squawking,   
perhaps there is something amiss.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s93">Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,
will actually harm it?</span>  <span class="s s94">Think about it.</span><span class="s s95">  There is something
very
    <i>
     American
    </i>
    about Feynman breaking into safes during
the Manhattan Project.</span>  <span class="s s96">It's hard to imagine the authorities
having a sense of humor about such things over
in Germany at that time.</span>  <span class="s s97">Maybe it's not a coincidence.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s99">Hackers are unruly.</span>  <span class="s s100">That is the essence of hacking.</span>  <span class="s s101">And it
is also the essence of Americanness.</span>  <span class="s s102">It is no accident
that Silicon Valley
is in America, and not France, or Germany,
or England, or Japan.</span> <span class="s s103">In those countries, people color inside
the lines.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">I lived for a while in Florence.</span>  <span class="s s106">But after I'd been there
a few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping
to find there was back in the place I'd just left.</span>
<span class="s s107">The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.</span>
<span class="s s108">In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious
people you find now in America.</span>  <span class="s s109">(So I went back to America.</span><span class="s s110">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s111">It is greatly to America's advantage that it is
a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness&acirc;&#128;&#148;that
it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.</span>
<span class="s s112">And hackers are invariably smart-alecks.</span>  <span class="s s113">If we had a national
holiday, it would be April 1st.</span>  <span class="s s114">It says a great deal about
our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a
horribly cheesy solution.</span>   <span class="s s115">When we cook one up we're not
always 100% sure which kind it is.</span>  <span class="s s116">But as long as it has
the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign.</span>
<span class="s s117">It's odd that people
think of programming as precise and methodical.</span><span class="s s118">
    <i>
     Computers
    </i>
    are precise and methodical.</span>  <span class="s s119">Hacking is something you do
with a gleeful laugh.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s121">In our world some of the most characteristic solutions
are not far removed from practical
jokes.</span>  <span class="s s122">IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences
of the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical
"adversary" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by
redefining it as one that's easier to solve.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s124">
    Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they
can
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/say.html">
     get away
    </a>
    with.</span>  <span class="s s125">And lately hackers 
have sensed a change
in the atmosphere.</span>
<span class="s s126">Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s128">To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems
especially ominous.</span>  <span class="s s129">That must also mystify outsiders.</span> 
<span class="s s130">Why should we care especially about civil
liberties?</span>  <span class="s s131">Why programmers, more than
dentists or salesmen or landscapers?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s133">Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.</span>
<span class="s s134">Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint
American tradition.</span>  <span class="s s135">Civil liberties make countries rich.</span>
<span class="s s136">If you made a graph of
GNP per capita vs.</span> <span class="s s137">civil liberties, you'd notice a definite
trend.</span>  <span class="s s138">Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather
than just an effect?</span>  <span class="s s139">I think so.</span>  <span class="s s140">I think a society in which
people can do and say what they want will also tend to
be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than
those sponsored by the most influential people.</span>
<span class="s s141">Authoritarian countries become corrupt;
corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak.</span> 
<span class="s s142">It seems to me there is
a Laffer curve for government power, just as for
tax revenues.</span>  <span class="s s143">At least, it seems likely enough that it
would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.</span>  <span class="s s144">Unlike
high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it
turns out to be a mistake.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s146">This is why hackers worry.</span>  <span class="s s147">The government spying on people doesn't
literally make programmers write worse code.</span>  <span class="s s148">It just leads
eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.</span>  <span class="s s149">And because
this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive
to it.</span>  <span class="s s150">They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a
distance, as animals can sense an approaching  
thunderstorm.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s152">It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures
intended to protect national security and intellectual property
turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes   
America successful.</span>  <span class="s s153">But it would not be the first time that
measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had
the opposite of the intended effect.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s155">There is such a thing as Americanness.</span>
<span class="s s156">There's nothing like living abroad to teach you that.</span>   
<span class="s s157">And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash
this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus
group than hackers, because they come closest of any group
I know to embodying it.</span>  <span class="s s158">Closer, probably,  than
the men running our government,
who for all their talk of patriotism
remind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin
than Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s160">When you read what the founding fathers had to say for
themselves, they sound more like hackers.</span>
<span class="s s161">"The spirit of resistance to government,"
Jefferson wrote, "is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish
it always to be kept alive.</span><span class="s s162">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s164">Imagine an American president saying that today.</span>
<span class="s s165">Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of
the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of
their less confident successors.</span>  <span class="s s166">They remind us where we come from.</span>
<span class="s s167">They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are
the source of America's wealth and power.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s169">
    Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be
obeyed.  But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.
