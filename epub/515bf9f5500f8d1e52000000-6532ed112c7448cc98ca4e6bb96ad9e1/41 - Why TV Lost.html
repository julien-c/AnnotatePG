   Why TV Lost
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   March 2009
  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">About twenty years ago people noticed computers and TV were on a
collision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce
when they converged.</span>  <span class="s s4">We now know the answer: computers.</span>  <span class="s s5">It's clear
now that even by using the word "convergence" we were giving TV too
much credit.</span>  <span class="s s6">This won't be convergence so much as replacement.</span>
<span class="s s7">People may still watch things they call "TV shows," but they'll
watch them mostly on computers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s9">What decided the contest for computers?</span>  <span class="s s10">Four forces, three of which
one could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s12">One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open
platform.</span>  <span class="s s13">Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market
picks the winners.</span>  <span class="s s14">So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead
of big company speeds.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s16">
   The second is Moore's Law, which has worked its usual magic on
Internet bandwidth.

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">The third reason computers won is piracy.</span> <span class="s s18">Users prefer it 
not just because it's free, but because it's
more convenient.</span>  <span class="s s19">Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new
generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer
screen.</span><span class="s s20">

  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s21">The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:
social applications.</span>  <span class="s s22">The average teenage kid has a pretty much
infinite capacity for talking to their friends.</span>  <span class="s s23">But they can't
physically be with them all the time.</span>  <span class="s s24">When I was in high school
the solution was the telephone.</span>  <span class="s s25">Now it's social networks, multiplayer
games, and various messaging applications.</span>  <span class="s s26">The way you reach them
all is through a computer.</span><span class="s s27">
                 
                  [
   <a name="f3" href="#f3n">

   </a>
   ]
                 
                 Which means every teenage kid (a)
wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive
to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front
of it.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s29">
   This was the most powerful force of all.  This was what made everyone
want computers.  Nerds got computers because they liked them.  Then
gamers got them to play games on.  But it was connecting to other
people that got everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and
14 year old girls want computers.
   </span><!--
Computers still aren't really ready for prime time.  I'm pretty
comfortable with technology, but I would be horrified at the prospect
of having to deal with the virus-ridden Windows machine the average
person uses.  I can't believe they put up with it.  But they will
to reach their friends.-->
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s30">After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,
people in the entertainment business had understandably come to
think of them as rather passive.</span>  <span class="s s31">They thought they'd be able to
dictate the way shows reached audiences.</span>  <span class="s s32">But they underestimated
the force of their desire to connect with one another.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s34">
   Facebook killed TV.  That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but
probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words.

  <p>
   <span class="s s36">The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are
going, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.</span>
<span class="s s37">But they're still dragging their heels.</span>  <span class="s s38">They still seem to wish
people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put
their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the
next morning and read them printed on paper.</span>  <span class="s s39">They should both just
face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier.</span>  <span class="s s42">When
a new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents
nervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win, and the best
thing they can do is jump in immediately.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s44">Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the
Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media:
synchronicity and locality.</span>  <span class="s s45">On the Internet, you don't have to
send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to
them from a local source.</span>  <span class="s s46">People will watch what they want when
they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared
interest they feel most strongly.</span>  <span class="s s47">Maybe their strongest shared
interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not.</span>
<span class="s s48">Which means local TV is probably dead.</span>  <span class="s s49">It was an artifact of
limitations imposed by old technology.</span>  <span class="s s50">If someone were creating
an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some
plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top
priority.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">Synchronicity and locality are tied together.</span>  <span class="s s53">TV network affiliates
care what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news
at 11.</span>  <span class="s s54">This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however:
people don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the
news afterward.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s56">TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have
sufficient flexibility to adapt to them.</span>  <span class="s s57">They're hemmed in by local
affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by
dealers and unions.</span>  <span class="s s58">Inevitably, the people running the networks
will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for
a couple more years, just as the record labels have done.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s60">
   A recent article in the
   <i>
    Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   described how TV networks
were trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers
watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it
suited them.</span>  <span class="s s61">Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're
trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks'
obsolete business model.</span>  <span class="s s62">That never works unless you have a monopoly
or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s64">The other reason networks like live shows is that they're cheaper
to produce.</span>  <span class="s s65">There they have the right idea, but they haven't
followed it to its conclusion.</span><span class="s s66">   Live content can be way cheaper
than networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic
decreases in cost is to
   <a target="_blank" href="http://justin.tv">
    increase volume
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s67">The networks are prevented
from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think
of themselves as being in the broadcast business&mdash;as sending one
signal to everyone.</span><span class="s s68">

    Now
   </a>
   would be a good time to start any company that competes with
TV networks.</span>  <span class="s s71">That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though
they may not have had this as an explicit goal.</span>  <span class="s s72">People only have
so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions
(unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way
quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with
it.</span>  <span class="s s73">But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV
companies will increasingly face direct ones.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s75">Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the
threshold you had to get over to start a new channel.</span>  <span class="s s76">It will be
longer on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it.</span>
<span class="s s77">In this new world, the existing players will only have the advantages
any big company has in its market.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s79">That will change the balance of power between the networks and the
people who produce shows.</span>  <span class="s s80">The networks used to be gatekeepers.</span>
<span class="s s81">They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.</span>  <span class="s s82">Now the
people who produce a show can distribute it themselves.</span>  <span class="s s83">The main
value networks supply now is ad sales.</span>  <span class="s s84">Which will tend to put them
in the position of service providers rather than publishers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s86">Shows will change even more.</span>  <span class="s s87">On the Internet there's no reason to
keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single
format.</span>  <span class="s s88">Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's
coming is between shows and games.</span>  <span class="s s89">But on the question of what
sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years,
I wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will
change a lot.</span>  <span class="s s90">We'll get whatever the most imaginative people can
cook up.</span>  <span class="s s91">That's why the Internet won.</span>

Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point.</span>  <span class="s s95">He adds: "I
remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when
they talked about convergence.</span>  <span class="s s96">They thought most programming would
be on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money.</span>
<span class="s s97">It didn't work out.</span> <span class="s s98">They assumed that their local network infrastructure
would be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn't
possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet.</span> <span class="s s99">At
the time (1992) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn't
enough for one video stream.</span> <span class="s s100">But wide-area bandwidth increased more
than they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu.</span><span class="s s101">"</span>

Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of
piracy, which is the lost revenue.</span>  <span class="s s104">They therefore think what drives
users to do it is the desire to get something for free.</span>  <span class="s s105">But iTunes
shows that people will pay for stuff online, if you make it easy.</span>
<span class="s s106">A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better
user experience.</span>

Or a phone that is actually a computer.</span>  <span class="s s109">I'm not making any
predictions about the size of the device that will replace TV, just
that it will have a browser and get data via the Internet.</span>

Emmett Shear writes: "I'd argue the long tail for sports may
be even larger than the long tail for other kinds of content.</span> <span class="s s112">Anyone
can broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting
to 10,000 people or so, even if the quality of production is not
so good.</span><span class="s s113">"</span>
