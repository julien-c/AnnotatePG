  <p>
   <span class="s s3">This essay developed out of conversations I've had with
several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious.</span>  <span class="s s4">It's not
a critique of Java!</span>  <span class="s s5">It is a case study of hacker's radar.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology.</span>
<span class="s s8">I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what
made Java seem suspect to me.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">Some people who've read this think it's an interesting attempt to write about
something that hasn't been written about before.</span>  <span class="s s11">Others say I
will get in trouble for appearing to be writing about
things I don't understand.</span>  <span class="s s12">So, just in
case it does any good, let me clarify that I'm not writing here
about Java (which I have never used) but about hacker's radar
(which I have thought about a lot).</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   </p><hr><p>
   <span class="s s14">The aphorism "you can't tell a book by its cover" originated in
the times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be
bound by each purchaser according to his own taste.</span>  <span class="s s15">In those days,
you couldn't tell a book by its cover.</span>  <span class="s s16">But publishing has advanced
since then: present-day publishers work hard to make the cover
something you can tell a book by.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s18">I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by now
learned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me about
a book, and perhaps a bit more.</span>  <span class="s s19">The time I haven't spent in
bookshops I've spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel as
if I've learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its cover
as well.</span>  <span class="s s20">It may be just luck, but I've saved myself from a few
technologies that turned out to be real stinkers.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s22">So far, Java seems like a stinker to me.</span>  <span class="s s23">I've never written a Java
program, never more than glanced over reference books about it,
but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language.</span>
<span class="s s24">I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology
is a dangerous business.</span>  <span class="s s25">But for what it's worth, as a sort of
time capsule, here's why I don't like the look of Java:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">1.</span> <span class="s s27">It has been so energetically hyped.</span>  <span class="s s28">Real standards don't have
to be promoted.</span>  <span class="s s29">No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML.</span>  <span class="s s30">A real
standard tends to be already established by the time most people
hear about it.</span>  <span class="s s31">On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java,
or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s33">2.</span> <span class="s s34">It's aimed low.</span>  <span class="s s35">In the original Java white paper, Gosling
explicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for
programmers used to C.</span>  <span class="s s36">It was designed to be another C++: C plus
a few ideas taken from more advanced languages.</span>  <span class="s s37">Like the creators
of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java's designers were
consciously designing a product for people not as smart as them.</span>
<span class="s s38">Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been
bad:  Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.</span>  <span class="s s39">The good languages have been
those that were designed for their own creators:  C, Perl, Smalltalk,
Lisp.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s41">3.</span> <span class="s s42">It has ulterior motives.</span>  <span class="s s43">Someone once said that the world would
be a better place if people only wrote books because they had
something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book.</span>
<span class="s s44">Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because
it has something to say about programming languages.</span>  <span class="s s45">We hear about
Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine Microsoft.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s47">4.</span> <span class="s s48">No one loves it.</span>  <span class="s s49">C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmers
love their languages.</span>  <span class="s s50">I've never heard anyone say that they loved
Java.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">5.</span> <span class="s s53">People are forced to use it.</span>  <span class="s s54">A lot of the people I know using
Java are using it because they feel they have to.</span>  <span class="s s55">Either it's
something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they
thought customers would want, or something they were told to do by
management.</span>  <span class="s s56">These are smart people; if the technology was good,
they'd have used it voluntarily.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s58">6.</span> <span class="s s59">It has too many cooks.</span>  <span class="s s60">The best programming languages have been
developed by small groups.</span>  <span class="s s61">Java seems to be run by a committee.</span>
<span class="s s62">If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the first time
in history that a committee has designed a good language.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s64">7.</span> <span class="s s65">It's bureaucratic.</span>  <span class="s s66">From what little I know about Java, there
seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things.</span>  <span class="s s67">Really good
languages aren't like that.</span>  <span class="s s68">They let you do what you want and get
out of the way.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s70">8.</span> <span class="s s71">It's pseudo-hip.</span>  <span class="s s72">Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots,
open-source language effort like Perl or Python.</span>  <span class="s s73">This one just
happens to be controlled by a giant company.</span>  <span class="s s74">So the language is
likely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes
out of a big company.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s76">9.</span> <span class="s s77">It's designed for large organizations.</span>  <span class="s s78">Large organizations have
different aims from hackers.</span> <span class="s s79">They want languages that are (believed
to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers--
languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul
trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage.</span>  <span class="s s80">Hackers don't
like a language that talks down to them.</span>  <span class="s s81">Hackers just want power.</span>
<span class="s s82">Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I,
Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won.</span>  <span class="s s83">The
reason: today's teenage hacker is tomorrow's CTO.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s85">10.</span> <span class="s s86">The wrong people like it.</span>  <span class="s s87">The programmers I admire most are
not, on the whole, captivated by Java.</span>  <span class="s s88">Who does like Java?</span>  <span class="s s89">Suits,
who don't know one language from another, but know that they keep
hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who
are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++;
and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that
might get them a job (will this be on the test?</span><span class="s s90">).</span>  <span class="s s91">These people's
opinions change with every wind.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s93">11.</span> <span class="s s94">Its daddy is in a pinch.</span>  <span class="s s95">Sun's business model is being undermined
on two fronts.</span>  <span class="s s96">Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used in
desktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers.</span>  <span class="s s97">And
FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris.</span>
<span class="s s98">Sun's advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial
strength applications.</span>  <span class="s s99">If this were true, Yahoo would be first in
line to buy Suns;  but when I worked there, the servers were all
Intel boxes running FreeBSD.</span>  <span class="s s100">This bodes ill for Sun's future.</span>  <span class="s s101">If
Sun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s103">12.</span> <span class="s s104">The DoD likes it.</span>  <span class="s s105">The Defense Department is encouraging
developers to use Java.</span> <span class="s s106">This seems to me the most damning sign of
all.</span>  <span class="s s107">The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of
defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and
protocols.</span>  <span class="s s108">Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; on
questions of software they will tend to bet wrong.</span>  <span class="s s109">The last time
the DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">Bear in mind, this is not a critique of Java, but a critique of
its cover.</span>  <span class="s s112">I don't know Java well enough to like it or dislike
it.</span>  <span class="s s113">This is just an explanation of why I don't find that I'm eager
to learn it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s115">It may seem cavalier to dismiss a language before you've even tried
writing programs in it.</span>  <span class="s s116">But this is something all programmers have
to do.</span>  <span class="s s117">There are too many technologies out there to learn them
all.</span>  <span class="s s118">You have to learn to judge by outward signs which will be
worth your time.</span>  <span class="s s119">I have likewise cavalierly dismissed Cobol, Ada,
Visual Basic, the IBM AS400, VRML, ISO 9000, the SET protocol, VMS,
Novell Netware, and CORBA, among others.</span>  <span class="s s120">They just smelled wrong.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s122">It could be that in Java's case I'm mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s123">It could be that a
language promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed
by a committee for a "mainstream" audience, hyped to the skies,
and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful,
powerful language that I would love programming in.</span>  <span class="s s124">It could be,
but it seems very unlikely.</span>
