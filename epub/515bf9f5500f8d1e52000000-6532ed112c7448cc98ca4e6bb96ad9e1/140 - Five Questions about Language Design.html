       1. Programming Languages Are for People.
      </b>
      </span></p><p align="justif">
       <span class="s s5">Programming languages
are how people talk to computers.</span>  <span class="s s6">The computer would be just as
happy speaking any language that was unambiguous.</span>  <span class="s s7">The reason we
have high level languages is because people can't deal with
machine language.</span>  <span class="s s8">The point of programming
languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being 
overwhelmed by a mass of detail.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span class="s s10">Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal
than others.</span>  <span class="s s11">One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems
is designing bridges.</span>  <span class="s s12">There your job is largely a matter of spanning
a given distance with the least material.</span>  <span class="s s13">The other end of the
spectrum is designing chairs.</span>  <span class="s s14">Chair designers have to spend their
time thinking about human butts.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span class="s s16">Software varies in the same way.</span> <span class="s s17">Designing algorithms for routing
data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing
bridges.</span>  <span class="s s18">Whereas designing programming languages is like designing
chairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span class="s s20">Most of us hate to acknowledge this.</span>  <span class="s s21">Designing systems of great
mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us
than pandering to human weaknesses.</span>  <span class="s s22">And there is a role for mathematical
elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.</span>
<span class="s s23">But elegance is not an end in itself.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span class="s s25">And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,
I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.</span><span class="s s26">
In fact I think you ought to design for the
       <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/design.html">
        best programmers
       </a>
       , but
even the best programmers have limitations.</span>  <span class="s s27">I don't think anyone
would like programming in a language where all the variables were
the letter x with integer subscripts.</span>
       </p><p align="left"><span class="s s29">
        <b>
         2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.
        </b>
        </span></p><p align="justif">
         <span class="s s30">If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best
ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a
lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s32">When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific
group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.</span>
<span class="s s33">So you get a language that talks down to you.</span>  <span class="s s34">Cobol is the most
extreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s36">It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.</span>  <span class="s s37">C is pretty
low-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's
why hackers like it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s39">The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that
there are more bad programmers than good programmers.</span>  <span class="s s40">That may be
so.</span>  <span class="s s41">But those few good programmers write a disproportionately
large percentage of the software.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s43">I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that
the very best hackers will like?</span>  <span class="s s44">I happen to think this is
identical to the question, how do you design a good programming
language?</span><span class="s s45">, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting
question.</span>

           3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.
          </b>
          </span></p><p align="justif">
           <span class="s s48">Many languages
(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude
of a governess: they try to prevent you from
doing things that they think aren't good for you.</span>  <span class="s s49">I like the   
opposite approach: give the programmer as much
control as you can.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
           <span class="s s51">When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was
that it considered me an equal partner.</span>  <span class="s s52">In the other languages
I had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   
program, written in the language, and the two were very separate.</span>
<span class="s s53">But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those
that made up the language itself.</span>  <span class="s s54">I could rewrite the language
if I wanted.</span>  <span class="s s55">It had the same appeal as open-source software.</span>
          </p>

            </b>
            </span></p><p align="justif">
             <span class="s s58">Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.</span>
<span class="s s59">But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they
really love it.</span>  <span class="s s60">How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly
of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple
lines of code?</span>  <span class="s s61">I think anything that really smart people really
love is worth paying attention to.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
             <span class="s s63">I think almost anything
you can do to make programs shorter is good.</span>  <span class="s s64">There should be lots
of library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;
the syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things
should be short.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
             <span class="s s66">And it's not only programs that should be short.</span>  <span class="s s67">The manual should
be thin as well.</span>  <span class="s s68">A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications
and reservations and warnings and special cases.</span>  <span class="s s69">If you force  
yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing
the things in the language that required so much explanation.</span>

               5. Admit What Hacking Is.

              </span></p><p align="justif">
               <span class="s s72">A lot of people wish that hacking was
mathematics, or at least something like a natural science.</span>  <span class="s s73">I think
hacking is more like architecture.</span>  <span class="s s74">Architecture is
related to physics, in the sense that architects have to design
buildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects
is to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
               <span class="s s76">What hackers like to do is make great programs.
And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's
an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work 
doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual
currency of research papers.</span>  <span class="s s77">Intellectually, it is just as
worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a
horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper
about.</span>

                  <span class="s s80">Libraries are becoming an
increasingly important component of programming languages.</span>  <span class="s s81">They're
also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.</span>  <span class="s s82">If it takes longer
to find the library function that will do what you want than it
would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing
but make your manual thick.</span>  <span class="s s83">(The Symbolics manuals were a case in 
point.</span><span class="s s84">)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize
libraries.</span>  <span class="s s85">The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer
could guess what library call would do the right thing.</span>

                    <span class="s s88">This is an open
problem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and
still don't know the answer.</span>  <span class="s s89">Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural
to me, except possibly for math.</span>  <span class="s s90">But it could be that a lot of 
Lisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.</span>   
<span class="s s91">Whether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question.</span>

                      <span class="s s94">I think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written
in the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning
programs that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web
browser.</span>  <span class="s s95">And to write these kinds of programs we may need some
new things.</span>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <span class="s s97">One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based 
apps get released.</span>  <span class="s s98">Instead of having one or two big releases a
year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a
series of small changes.</span>  <span class="s s99">You may have as many as five or ten
releases a day.</span>  <span class="s s100">And as a rule everyone will always use the latest
version.</span>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <span class="s s102">You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?</span>
<span class="s s103">Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be
changeable.</span>  <span class="s s104">You have to be able to change it easily, or at least
to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.</span>
                     </p>

software, surprisingly, is continuations.</span><span class="s s107">  In Web-based software
you can use something like continuation-passing style to get the
effect of

                       subroutines

                      in the inherently 
stateless world of a Web
session.</span>  <span class="s s108">Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,
if it was not too expensive.</span>

programs used to mean writing desktop software.</span>  <span class="s s118">And in desktop
software there is a big bias toward writing the application in the
same language as the operating system.</span>  <span class="s s119">And so ten years ago,
writing software pretty much meant writing software in C.</span>
<span class="s s120">Eventually a tradition evolved:
application programs must not be written in unusual languages.</span>  
<span class="s s121">And this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people
like managers and venture capitalists also learned it.</span>

writing software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway
