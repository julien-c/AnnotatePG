    How to Present to Investors
   </span></h1>
   </h2><p>
    </p><p><span class="s s2">
     August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010
    </span></p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s3">In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.</span>  <span class="s s4">Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.</span>  <span class="s s5">Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s7">Ten weeks is not much time.</span>  <span class="s s8">The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.</span>  <span class="s s9">But the average
startup fails.</span>  <span class="s s10">When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work.</span>  <span class="s s11">Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s13">
     (Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,
so we don't give them much money either.)
    </span></p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s14">A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day.</span>
<span class="s s15">At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not at
Rehearsal Day.</span>  <span class="s s16">No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s18">The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough.</span>  <span class="s s19">But this is
to be expected.</span>  <span class="s s20">We try to pick founders who are good at building
things, not ones who are slick presenters.</span>  <span class="s s21">Some of the founders
are just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spoken
to a group of people they didn't already know.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s23">So we concentrate on the basics.</span>  <span class="s s24">On Demo Day each startup will
only get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two
goals: (a) explain what you're doing, and (b) explain why users
will want it.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s26">That might sound easy, but it's not when the speakers have no
experience presenting, and they're explaining technical matters to
an audience that's mostly non-technical.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s28">This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to
investors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people who
are bad at understanding.</span>  <span class="s s29">Practically every successful startup,
including stars like Google, presented at some point to investors
who didn't get it and turned them down.</span>  <span class="s s30">Was it because the founders
were bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse?</span>  <span class="s s31">It's
probably always some of both.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s33">At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners found
ourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two.</span>
<span class="s s34">So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting
to investors.</span>  <span class="s s35">Most startups face similar challenges, so we hope
these will be useful to a wider audience.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s37">
     1. Explain what you're doing.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s38">Investors' main question when judging a very early startup is whether
you've made a compelling product.</span>  <span class="s s39">Before they can judge whether
you've built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you've
built.</span>  <span class="s s40">They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them
what you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s42">Say what you're doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first
sentence.</span> <span class="s s43">"We're Jeff and Bob and we've built an easy to use web-based
database.</span>  <span class="s s44">Now we'll show it to you and explain why people need
this.</span><span class="s s45">"</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s47">If you're a great public speaker you may be able to violate this
rule.</span>  <span class="s s48">Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk
on a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop
metaphor.</span>  <span class="s s49">He got away with it, but unless you're a captivating
speaker, which most hackers aren't, it's better to play it safe.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s51">
     2. Get rapidly to demo.
    </span></h3>
    <p><span class="s s52">
     <i>
      This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting
at Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short
that they rarely include much if any demo.  They seem to work
just as well without, however, which makes me think I was
wrong to emphasize demos so much before.
     </i>
    </span></p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s53">A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal
description.</span>  <span class="s s54">The only thing worth talking about first is the problem
you're trying to solve and why it's important.</span>  <span class="s s55">But don't spend
more than a tenth of your time on that.</span>  <span class="s s56">Then demo.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s58">When you demo, don't run through a catalog of features.</span>  <span class="s s59">Instead
start with the problem you're solving, and then show how your product
solves it.</span>  <span class="s s60">Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose,
rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s62">If you're demoing something web-based, assume that the network
connection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation,
and come prepared with a copy of the server software running on
your laptop.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s64">
     3. Better a narrow description than a vague one.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s65">One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is
that, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities.</span>
<span class="s s66">The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow.</span>  <span class="s s67">So for
example a group that has built an easy web-based database might
resist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so much
more.</span>  <span class="s s68">In fact, it could be anything.</span><span class="s s69">.</span><span class="s s70">.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s72">The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description
of something that could be anything, the content of your description
approaches zero.</span>  <span class="s s73">If you describe your web-based database as "a
system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of
information," it will go in one investor ear and out the other.</span>
<span class="s s74">They'll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, and
hope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you'll
actually explain what you've made.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s76">Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might
one day become, but simply to convince investors you're worth talking
to further.</span>  <span class="s s77">So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right
answer by successive approximations.</span>  <span class="s s78">Begin with a description
that's gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to the
extent you can.</span>  <span class="s s79">It's the same principle as incremental development:
start with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every point
have working code.</span>  <span class="s s80">In this case, "working code" means a working
description in the investor's head.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s82">
     4. Don't talk and drive.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s83">Have one person talk while another uses the computer.</span>  <span class="s s84">If the same
person does both, they'll inevitably mumble downwards at the computer
screen instead of talking clearly at the audience.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s86">As long as you're standing near the audience and looking at them,
politeness (and habit) compel them to pay attention to you.</span>  <span class="s s87">Once
you stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer,
their minds drift off to the errands they have to run later.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s89">
     5. Don't talk about secondary matters at length.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s90">If you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what your
product does and why it's great.</span>  <span class="s s91">Second order issues like competitors
or resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at the
end.</span>  <span class="s s92">If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screen
for 15 seconds and say a few words.</span>  <span class="s s93">For competitors, list the top
3 and explain in one sentence each what they lack
that you have.</span>  <span class="s s94">And put this kind of thing at the end, after you've
made it clear what you've built.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s96">
     6. Don't get too deeply into business models.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s97">It's good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly
because it shows you care about that and have thought about it.</span>
<span class="s s98">Don't go into detail about your business model, because (a) that's
not what smart investors care about in a brief presentation, and
(b) any business model you have at this point is probably wrong
anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s100">Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about a
company he just invested in.</span>  <span class="s s101">He said their business model was wrong
and would probably change three times before they got it right.</span>
<span class="s s102">The founders were experienced guys who'd done startups before and
who'd just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VC
firms, and even their business model was crap.</span>  <span class="s s103">(And yet he invested
anyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.</span><span class="s s104">)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s105">If you're solving an important problem, you're going to sound a lot
smarter talking about that than the business model.</span>  <span class="s s106">The business
model is just a bunch of guesses, and guesses about stuff that's
probably not your area of expertise.</span>  <span class="s s107">So don't spend your precious
few minutes talking about crap when you could be talking about
solid, interesting things you know a lot about: the problem you're
solving and what you've built so far.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s109">As well as being a bad use of time, if your business model seems
spectacularly wrong, that will push the stuff you want investors
to remember out of their heads.</span>  <span class="s s110">They'll just remember you as the
company with the boneheaded plan for making money, rather than the
company that solved that important problem.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s112">
     7. Talk slowly and clearly at the audience.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s113">Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the people
who'd been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups,
and those who hadn't.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s115">You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking to
a roomful of people than you would in conversation.</span>  <span class="s s116">Everyday life
gives you no practice in this.</span>  <span class="s s117">If you can't already do it, the
best solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick,
like juggling.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s119">However, that doesn't mean you should talk like some kind of
announcer.</span>  <span class="s s120">Audiences tune that out.</span>  <span class="s s121">What you need to do is talk
in this artificial way, and yet make it seem conversational.</span>  <span class="s s122">(Writing
is the same.</span>  <span class="s s123">Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.</span><span class="s s124">)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s125">If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand and
memorize it, that's ok.</span>  <span class="s s126">That has worked for some groups in the
past.</span>  <span class="s s127">But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous,
informal speech, and deliver it that way too.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s129">Err on the side of speaking slowly.</span>  <span class="s s130">At Rehearsal Day, one of the founders
mentioned a rule actors use: if you feel you're speaking too slowly,
you're speaking at about the right speed.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s132">
     8. Have one person talk.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s133">Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners.</span>
<span class="s s134">This is a good instinct; investors dislike unbalanced teams.  But
trying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going too
far.</span>  <span class="s s135">It's distracting.</span>  <span class="s s136">You can demonstrate your respect
for one another in more subtle ways.</span>  <span class="s s137">For example, when one of the
groups presented at Demo Day, the more extroverted of the two
founders did most of the talking, but he described his co-founder
as the best hacker he'd ever met, and you could tell he meant it.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s139">
     Pick the one or at most two best speakers, and have them do most
of the talking.
    </span></p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s140">Exception: If one of the founders is an expert in some specific
technical field, it can be good for them to talk about that for a
minute or so.</span>  <span class="s s141">This kind of "expert witness" can add credibility,
even if the audience doesn't understand all the details.</span>  <span class="s s142">If Jobs
and Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II, it might be a good plan
to have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minute
in the middle about some of the technical feats he'd pulled off in
the design.</span>  <span class="s s143">(Though of course if it were actually those two, Jobs
would speak for the entire 10 minutes.</span><span class="s s144">)</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s145">
     9. Seem confident.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s146">Between the brief time available and their lack of technical
background, many in the audience will have a hard time evaluating
what you're doing.</span>  <span class="s s147">Probably the single biggest piece of evidence,
initially, will be your own confidence in it.</span>   <span class="s s148">You have
to show you're impressed with what you've made.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s150">And I mean show, not tell.</span>  <span class="s s151">Never say "we're passionate" or "our
product is great.</span><span class="s s152">"</span>  <span class="s s153">People just ignore that&mdash;or worse, write you
off as bullshitters.</span>  <span class="s s154">Such messages must be implicit.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s156">What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic.</span><span class="s s157">  If you've
truly made something good, you're doing investors a
     <i>
      favor
     </i>
     by
telling them about it.</span>  <span class="s s158">If you don't genuinely believe that, perhaps
you ought to change what your company is doing.</span>  <span class="s s159">If you don't believe
your startup has such promise that you'd be doing them a favor by
letting them invest, why are you investing your time in it?</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s161">
     10. Don't try to seem more than you are.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s162">Don't worry if your company is just a few months old and doesn't
have an office yet, or your founders are technical people with no
business experience.</span>  <span class="s s163">Google was like that once, and they turned out
ok.</span>  <span class="s s164">Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws.</span>  <span class="s s165">They're
not looking for finished, smooth presentations.</span>  <span class="s s166">They're looking
for raw talent.</span>  <span class="s s167">All you need to convince them of is that you're
smart and that you're onto something good.</span>  <span class="s s168">If you try too hard to
conceal your rawness&mdash;by trying to seem corporate, or pretending
to know about stuff you don't&mdash;you may just conceal your talent.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s170">You can afford to be candid about what you haven't figured out yet.</span>
<span class="s s171">Don't go out of your way to bring it up (e.</span><span class="s s172">g.</span> <span class="s s173">by having a slide
about what might go wrong), but don't try to pretend either that
you're further along than you are.</span>  <span class="s s174">If you're a hacker and you're
presenting to experienced investors, they're probably better at
detecting bullshit than you are at producing it.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s176">
     11. Don't put too many words on slides.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s177">When there are a lot of words on a slide, people just skip reading
it.</span>  <span class="s s178">So look at your slides and ask of each word "could I cross
this out?</span><span class="s s179">"</span>  <span class="s s180">This includes gratuitous clip art.</span>  <span class="s s181">Try to get your
slides under 20 words if you can.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s183">Don't read your slides.</span>  <span class="s s184">They should be something in the background
as you face the audience and talk to them, not something you face
and read to an audience sitting behind you.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s186">Cluttered sites don't do well in demos, especially when they're
projected onto a screen.</span>  <span class="s s187">At the very least, crank up the font size
big enough to make all the text legible.</span>  <span class="s s188">But cluttered sites are
bad anyway, so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make your
design simpler.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s190">
     12. Specific numbers are good.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s191">If you have any kind of data, however preliminary, tell the audience.</span>
<span class="s s192">Numbers stick in people's heads.</span>  <span class="s s193">If you can claim that the median
visitor generates 12 page views, that's great.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s195">But don't give them more than four or five numbers, and only give
them numbers specific to you.</span>  <span class="s s196">You don't need to tell them the size
of the market you're in.</span>  <span class="s s197">Who cares, really, if it's 500 million
or 5 billion a year?</span>  <span class="s s198">Talking about that is like an actor at the
beginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanks
makes.</span>  <span class="s s199">Yeah, sure, but first you have to become Tom Hanks.</span>  <span class="s s200">The
important part is not whether he makes ten million a year or a
hundred, but how you get there.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s202">
     13. Tell stories about users.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s203">The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups is
that you've built something based on your own a priori theories of
what the world needs, but that no one will actually want.</span>  <span class="s s204">So it's
good if you can talk about problems specific users have and how you
solve them.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s206">Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the "proxy for
demand.</span><span class="s s207">"</span>  <span class="s s208">What are people doing now, using inadequate tools, that
shows they need what you're making?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s210">Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something.</span>
<span class="s s211">It's easy to convince investors there will be demand for
a cheaper alternative to something popular, if you preserve
the qualities that made it popular.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s213">The best stories about user needs are about your own.</span>  <span class="s s214">A remarkable
number of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had:
Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google.</span>  <span class="s s215">Experienced investors know that,
so stories of this type will get their attention.</span>  <span class="s s216">The next best
thing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally,
like your friends or siblings.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="s s218">
     14. Make a soundbite stick in their heads.
    </span></h3>
    <p>
     <span class="s s219">Professional investors hear a lot of pitches.</span>  <span class="s s220">After a while they
all blur together.</span>  <span class="s s221">The first cut is simply to be one of those
they remember.</span>  <span class="s s222">And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptive
phrase about yourself that sticks in their heads.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="s s224">
     In Hollywood, these phrases seem to be of the form "x meets y."
     </span><!-- "Brokeback Mountain meets Godzilla."  [Pauses to contemplate this.] --><span class="s s225">
     In the startup world, they're usually "the x of y" or "the x y."
Viaweb's was "the Microsoft Word of ecommerce."
    </span></p>
    <p><span class="s s226">
     Find one and launch it clearly (but apparently casually) in your
talk, preferably near the beginning.
    </span></p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s227">It's a good exercise for you, too, to sit down and try to figure
out how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase.</span>  <span class="s s228">If you
can't, your plans may not be sufficiently focused.</span>
