   <p><span class="s s4">
    In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I
started a startup called
    <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html">
     Viaweb
    </a>
    .</span>  
<span class="s s5">Our plan was to write
software that would let end users build online stores.</span>
<span class="s s6">What was novel about this software, at the time, was
that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages
as the interface.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">A lot of people could have been having this idea at the
same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was
the first Web-based application.</span>  <span class="s s9">It seemed such
a novel idea to us that we named the company after it:
Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,
instead of running on your desktop computer.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s11">Another unusual thing about this software was that it
was written primarily in a programming language called
Lisp.</span> <span class="s s12">It was one of the first big end-user
applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then
had been used mostly in universities and research labs.</span> <span class="s s13">[1]</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s14">
    The Secret Weapon
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">Eric Raymond has written an essay called "How to Become a Hacker,"
and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what
languages they should learn.</span>  <span class="s s16">He suggests starting with Python and
Java, because they are easy to learn.</span>  <span class="s s17">The serious hacker will also
want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system
administration and cgi scripts.</span>  <span class="s s18">Finally, the truly serious hacker
should consider learning Lisp:</span>
    </p><blockquote>
     <span class="s s19">Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</span>
    </blockquote><span class="s s21">
    This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  It
won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but
it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages
you do want to use, like English.
   
   </span><p>
    <span class="s s22">But wait a minute.</span>  <span class="s s23">This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.</span>  <span class="s s24">The
reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.</span>  <span class="s s25">If you
write in Latin, no one can understand you.</span>  <span class="s s26">But Lisp is a computer
language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,
tell them to.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s28">So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't
you want to use it?</span> <span class="s s29">If a painter were offered a brush that would
make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to
use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he?</span> <span class="s s30">I'm not trying to make
fun of Eric Raymond here.</span>  <span class="s s31">On the whole, his advice is good.</span>  <span class="s s32">What
he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.</span>  <span class="s s33">But
there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will
make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">Why not?</span>  <span class="s s36">Programming languages are just tools, after all.</span>  <span class="s s37">If Lisp
really does yield better programs, you should use it.</span>  <span class="s s38">And if it
doesn't, then who needs it?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s40">This is not just a theoretical question.</span>  <span class="s s41">Software is a very
competitive business, prone to natural monopolies.</span>  <span class="s s42">A company that
gets software written faster and better will, all other things
being equal, put its competitors out of business.</span>  <span class="s s43">And when you're
starting a startup, you feel this very keenly.</span>  <span class="s s44">Startups tend to
be an all or nothing proposition.</span>  <span class="s s45">You either get rich, or you get
nothing.</span>  <span class="s s46">In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your
competitors will crush you.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s48">Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason
not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.</span>  <span class="s s49">We knew that everyone
else was writing their software in C++ or Perl.</span>  <span class="s s50">But we also knew
that that didn't mean anything.</span>  <span class="s s51">If you chose technology that way,
you'd be running Windows.</span>  <span class="s s52">When you choose technology, you have to
ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will
work the best.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">This is especially true in a startup.</span>  <span class="s s55">In a big company, you can
do what all the other big companies are doing.</span>  <span class="s s56">But a startup can't
do what all the other startups do.</span>  <span class="s s57">I don't think a lot of people
realize this, even in startups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">The average big company grows at about ten percent a year.</span>  <span class="s s60">So if
you're running a big company and you do everything the way the
average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the
average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s62">The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course.</span>
<span class="s s63">If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should
expect average performance.</span>  <span class="s s64">The problem here is, average performance
means that you'll go out of business.</span>  <span class="s s65">The survival rate for startups
is way less than fifty percent.</span>  <span class="s s66">So if you're running a startup,
you had better be doing something odd.</span>  <span class="s s67">If not, you're in trouble.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s69">Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors
understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing
software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use
any language you want.</span>  <span class="s s70">When you're writing desktop software,
there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same
language as the operating system.</span>  <span class="s s71">Ten years ago, writing applications
meant writing applications in C.</span>  <span class="s s72">But with Web-based software,
especially when you have the source code of both the language and
the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s74">This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.</span>  <span class="s s75">Now that you
can use any language, you have to think about which one to use.</span>
<span class="s s76">Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that
their competitors do not.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">If you can use any language, which do you use?</span>  <span class="s s79">We chose Lisp.</span>
<span class="s s80">For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be
important in this market.</span>  <span class="s s81">We were all starting from scratch, so
a company that could get new features done before its competitors
would have a big advantage.</span>  <span class="s s82">We knew Lisp was a really good language
for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify
the effect of rapid development, because you can release software
the minute it's done.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s84">If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better.</span>
<span class="s s85">It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help
we could get.</span>  <span class="s s86">When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in
business.</span>  <span class="s s87">We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring
people, or raising money, or getting customers.</span>  <span class="s s88">Neither of us had
ever even had what you would call a real job.</span>  <span class="s s89">The only thing we
were good at was writing software.</span>  <span class="s s90">We hoped that would save us.</span>
<span class="s s91">Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would
take.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s93">So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.</span>  <span class="s s94">Our hypothesis
was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get
features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things
in our software that they couldn't do.</span>  <span class="s s95">And because Lisp was so
high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs
would be lower.</span>  <span class="s s96">If this were so, we could offer a better product
for less money, and still make a profit.</span>  <span class="s s97">We would end up getting
all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually
go out of business.</span>  <span class="s s98">That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s100">What were the results of this experiment?</span>  <span class="s s101">Somewhat surprisingly,
it worked.</span>  <span class="s s102">We eventually had many competitors, on the order of
twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete
with ours.</span>  <span class="s s103">We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the
server and yet felt like a desktop application.</span>  <span class="s s104">Our competitors
had cgi scripts.</span>  <span class="s s105">And we were always far ahead of them in features.</span>
<span class="s s106">Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce
features that we didn't have.</span>  <span class="s s107">But with Lisp our development cycle
was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within
a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.</span>  <span class="s s108">By
the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling
us, we would have the new feature too.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s110">It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of
secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or
something.</span>  <span class="s s111">In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler
than they realized.</span>  <span class="s s112">No one was leaking news of their features to
us.</span>   <span class="s s113">We were just able to develop software faster than anyone
thought possible.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s115">
    When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of
    <i>
     The Day
of the Jackal,
    </i>
    by Frederick Forsyth.</span>  <span class="s s116">The main character is an
assassin who is hired to kill the president of France.</span>  <span class="s s117">The assassin
has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks
the president's route.</span>  <span class="s s118">He walks right by them, dressed up as an
old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s120">Our secret weapon was similar.</span>  <span class="s s121">We wrote our software in a weird
AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.</span>  <span class="s s122">For years
it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.</span>  <span class="s s123">But now it
worked to our advantage.</span>  <span class="s s124">In business, there is nothing more valuable
than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand.</span>  <span class="s s125">In
business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s127">And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything
publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.</span>  <span class="s s128">We never
mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web
site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio.</span>  <span class="s s129">This
was no accident.</span>  <span class="s s130">A startup should give its competitors as little
information as possible.</span>  <span class="s s131">If they didn't know what language our
software was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that
way.</span><span class="s s132">[2]</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s133">The people who understood our technology best were the customers.</span>
<span class="s s134">They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but
they noticed that it worked really well.</span>  <span class="s s135">It let them build great
looking online stores literally in minutes.</span>  <span class="s s136">And so, by word of
mouth mostly, we got more and more users.</span>  <span class="s s137">By the end of 1996 we
had about 70 stores online.</span>  <span class="s s138">At the end of 1997 we had 500.</span>  <span class="s s139">Six
months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.</span>  <span class="s s140">Today, as
Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.</span>  <span class="s s141">It's
one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built
with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.</span>  <span class="s s142">I left Yahoo in
1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but
the last I heard there were about 20,000.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- People sometimes ask me if Yahoo Store still uses Lisp.  Yes, all
the Lisp code is still there.  Yahoo has server-side software
written in all five of the languages Eric Raymond recommends to
hackers.

     The Blub Paradox
     </span></b></p><p>
      <span class="s s145">What's so great about Lisp?</span>  <span class="s s146">And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't
everyone use it?</span>  <span class="s s147">These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually
they have straightforward answers.</span>  <span class="s s148">Lisp is so great not because
of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is
simply the most powerful language available.</span>  <span class="s s149">And the reason everyone
doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely
technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes
slower.</span>  <span class="s s150">Of course, both these answers need explaining.</span>
     </p>
     <p><span class="s s152">
      I'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming
languages vary in power.
     </span></p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s153">Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more
powerful than machine language.</span>  <span class="s s154">Most programmers today would agree
that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.</span>
<span class="s s155">Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a
compiler translate it into machine language for you.</span>  <span class="s s156">This idea is
even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets
have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s158">Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand
in machine language.</span>  <span class="s s159">What's less often understood is that there
is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of
several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake
to program in anything but the most powerful one.</span> <span class="s s160">[3]</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s161">There are many exceptions to this rule.</span>  <span class="s s162">If you're writing a program
that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain
language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the
same language.</span>  <span class="s s163">If you're writing a program that only has to do
something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,
you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it
may be slightly faster.</span>  <span class="s s164">And if you're writing a short, throwaway
program, you may be better off just using whatever language has
the best library functions for the task.</span>  <span class="s s165">But in general, for
application software, you want to be using the most powerful
(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything
else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a
lesser degree, as programming in machine language.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s167">You can see that machine language is very low level.</span>  <span class="s s168">But, at least
as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all
treated as equivalent.</span>  <span class="s s169">They're not.</span>  <span class="s s170">Technically the term "high-level
language" doesn't mean anything very definite.</span>  <span class="s s171">There's no dividing
line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level
languages on the other.</span>  <span class="s s172">Languages fall along a continuum [4] of
abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine
languages, which themselves vary in power.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s174">Consider Cobol.</span>  <span class="s s175">Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that
it gets compiled into machine language.</span>  <span class="s s176">Would anyone seriously
argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?</span>  <span class="s s177">It's
probably closer to machine language than Python.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s179">Or how about Perl 4?</span>  <span class="s s180">Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures
got added to the language.</span>  <span class="s s181">Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl
5 is more powerful than Perl 4.</span>  <span class="s s182">But once you've admitted that,
you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful
than another.</span>  <span class="s s183">And it follows inexorably that, except in special
cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s185">This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.</span>  <span class="s s186">After a
certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.</span>
<span class="s s187">Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider
just good enough.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s189">Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I
don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm
going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.</span>  <span class="s s190">Blub falls right
in the middle of the abstractness continuum.</span>  <span class="s s191">It is not the most
powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine
language.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s193">And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either
of them.</span>  <span class="s s194">Of course he wouldn't program in machine language.</span>  <span class="s s195">That's
what compilers are for.</span>  <span class="s s196">And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how
anyone can get anything done with it.</span>  <span class="s s197">It doesn't even have x (Blub
feature of your choice).</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s199">As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the
power continuum, he knows he's looking down.</span>  <span class="s s200">Languages less powerful
than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some
feature he's used to.</span>  <span class="s s201">But when our hypothetical Blub programmer
looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't
realize he's looking up.</span>  <span class="s s202">What he sees are merely weird languages.</span>
<span class="s s203">He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but
with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.</span>  <span class="s s204">Blub is good
enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s206">When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of
the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that
he in turn looks down upon Blub.</span>  <span class="s s207">How can you get anything done in
Blub?</span> <span class="s s208">It doesn't even have y.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s210">By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the
differences in power between the various languages are those who
understand the most powerful one.</span>  <span class="s s211">(This is probably what Eric
Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.</span><span class="s s212">) You can't
trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:
they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because
it dictates the way they think about programs.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s213">I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing
programs in Basic.</span>  <span class="s s214">That language didn't even support recursion.</span>
<span class="s s215">It's hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but
I didn't miss it at the time.</span>  <span class="s s216">I thought in Basic.</span>  <span class="s s217">And I was a
whiz at it.</span>  <span class="s s218">Master of all I surveyed.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s220">The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at
various points on the power continuum.</span>  <span class="s s221">Where they fall relative
to one another is a sensitive topic.</span>  <span class="s s222">What I will say is that I
think Lisp is at the top.</span>  <span class="s s223">And to support this claim I'll tell you
about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other
four languages.</span>  <span class="s s224">How can you get anything done in them, I think,
without macros?</span> <span class="s s225">[5]</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s226">Many languages have something called a macro.</span>  <span class="s s227">But Lisp macros are
unique.</span>  <span class="s s228">And believe it or not, what they do is related to the
parentheses.</span>  <span class="s s229">The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses
in the language just to be different.</span>  <span class="s s230">To the Blub programmer, Lisp
code looks weird.</span>  <span class="s s231">But those parentheses are there for a reason.</span>
<span class="s s232">They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between
Lisp and other languages.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s234">Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.</span>  <span class="s s235">And not in the trivial
sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are
one of the data types supported by the language.</span>  <span class="s s236">Lisp code, after
it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can
traverse.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s238">If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is
not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no
syntax.</span>  <span class="s s239">You write programs in the parse trees that get generated
within the compiler when other languages are parsed.</span>  <span class="s s240">But these
parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can write
programs that manipulate them.</span>  <span class="s s241">In Lisp, these programs are called
macros.</span>  <span class="s s242">They are programs that write programs.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s243">Programs that write programs?</span>  <span class="s s244">When would you ever want to do that?</span>

     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s252">But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.</span>
<span class="s s253">The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%
macros.</span>  <span class="s s254">Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,
and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not
necessary.</span>  <span class="s s255">So every macro in that code is there because it has to
be.</span>  <span class="s s256">What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this
program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other
language.</span>  <span class="s s257">However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my
claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him
curious.</span>  <span class="s s258">We weren't writing this code for our own amusement.</span>  <span class="s s259">We
were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to
put technical barriers between us and our competitors.</span>

     <p>
      <span class="s s261">A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some
correlation here.</span>  <span class="s s262">A big chunk of our code was doing things that
are very hard to do in other languages.</span>  <span class="s s263">The resulting software
did things our competitors' software couldn't do.</span>  <span class="s s264">Maybe there was
some kind of connection.</span>  <span class="s s265">I encourage you to follow that thread.</span>

to go out and learn
Lisp.</span>  <span class="s s270">The purpose of this article is not to change anyone's mind,
but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people
who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it
isn't widely used.</span>  <span class="s s271">In a competitive situation, that's an advantage.</span>
<span class="s s272">Lisp's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don't
get it.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s274">If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn't worry that
it isn't widely understood.</span>  <span class="s s275">You should hope that it stays that
way.</span> <span class="s s276">And it's likely to.</span>  <span class="s s277">It's the nature of programming languages
to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.</span>
<span class="s s278">Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that
programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the
processor.</span>  <span class="s s279">At places like MIT they were writing programs in
high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued
to write code in machine language well into the 1980s.</span>  <span class="s s280">I bet a
lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor,
like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them
out by switching to a risc instruction set.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s282">Ordinarily technology changes fast.</span>  <span class="s s283">But programming languages are
different: programming languages are not just technology, but what
programmers think in.</span>  <span class="s s284">They're half technology and half religion.</span><span class="s s285">[6]
And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median
programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.</span>  <span class="s s286">Garbage collection,
introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be
a good thing.</span>  <span class="s s287">Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity.</span>
<span class="s s288">Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now,
just barely, on the radar screen.</span>  <span class="s s289">Macros, introduced by Lisp in the
mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s291">Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum.</span>  <span class="s s292">I'm not
proposing that you can fight this powerful force.</span>  <span class="s s293">What I'm proposing
is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you
can use it against your opponents.</span>

     <p>
      <span class="s s295">If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.</span>  <span class="s s296">You will have
a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build
things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other
language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over
the world.</span>  <span class="s s297">But if you work for a startup that doesn't have
pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub
paradox to your advantage:  you can use technology that your
competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be
able to match.</span>

     <p>
      <span class="s s299">If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here's a handy
tip for evaluating competitors.</span>  <span class="s s300">Read their job listings.</span>  <span class="s s301">Everything
else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent,
but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or
they'll get the wrong candidates.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s303">During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.</span>
<span class="s s304">A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month
or so.</span>  <span class="s s305">The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they
had a live online demo, was look at their job listings.</span>  <span class="s s306">After a
couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about
and which not to.</span>  <span class="s s307">The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions
had, the less dangerous the company was.</span>  <span class="s s308">The safest kind were the
ones that wanted Oracle experience.</span>  <span class="s s309">You never had to worry about
those.</span>  <span class="s s310">You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java
developers.</span>  <span class="s s311">If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would
be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company
where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.</span>  <span class="s s312">If I
had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have
been really worried.</span>

      Notes
     </span></h3>
     <p>
      <span class="s s315">[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp,
which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system,
written in C, which handled orders.</span>  <span class="s s316">The first version was mostly
Lisp, because the ordering system was small.</span>  <span class="s s317">Later we added two
more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office
manager written mostly in Perl.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s319">In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor 
written in C++ and Perl.</span>  <span class="s s320">It's hard to say whether the program is no
longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program
into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source
files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I
know,  Lisp code.</span><span class="s s321">  (See
      <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/quotes.html">
       Greenspun's Tenth Rule

     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s323">[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because
even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't
have understood why:  "If they were that smart they'd already be
programming in Lisp.</span><span class="s s324">"</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s326">[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing
equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care
about.</span> <span class="s s327">(No one wants to program a Turing machine.</span><span class="s s328">)  The kind of
power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but
one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features
you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an
interpreter for the more powerful language in it.</span> <span class="s s329">If language A
has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B
doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you
can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.</span>  <span class="s s330">But if A supports,
say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something
you can fix by writing library functions.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s332">[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top;
it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at
least a partial order.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s334">[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.</span>
<span class="s s335">In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp
features like lexical closures and rest parameters.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s337">[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take
the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly
neutral that they're really works of anthropology.</span>  <span class="s s338">People who
value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.</span>  <span class="s s339">But the question
is only half a religious one; there is something there worth
studying, especially if you want to design new languages.</span>
