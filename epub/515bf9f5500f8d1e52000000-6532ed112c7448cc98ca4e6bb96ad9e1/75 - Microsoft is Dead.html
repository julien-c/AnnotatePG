   Microsoft is Dead
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   April 2007
  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.</span>  <span class="s s4">I was talking
to a young startup founder about how Google was different from
Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s5">I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by
their fear of Microsoft.</span>  <span class="s s6">That was why they'd positioned themselves
as a "media company" instead of a technology company.</span>  <span class="s s7">Then I looked
at his face and realized he didn't understand.</span>  <span class="s s8">It was as if I'd
told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid
80s.</span>  <span class="s s9">Barry who?</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s11">
   Microsoft?  He didn't say anything, but I could tell he didn't quite
believe anyone would be frightened of them.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s12">Microsoft cast
a shadow over the software world for almost 20 years
starting in the late 80s.</span>
<span class="s s13">I can remember when it was IBM before them.</span>  <span class="s s14">I mostly ignored this
shadow.</span>  <span class="s s15">I never used Microsoft software, so it only affected me
indirectly&acirc;&#128;&#148;for example, in the spam I got from botnets.</span>  <span class="s s16">And
because I wasn't paying attention, I didn't notice when the shadow
disappeared.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s18">But it's gone now.</span>  <span class="s s19">I can sense that.</span>  <span class="s s20">No one is even afraid of
Microsoft anymore.</span>  <span class="s s21">They still make a lot of money&acirc;&#128;&#148;so does IBM,
for that matter.</span>  <span class="s s22">But they're not dangerous.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s24">When did Microsoft die, and of what?</span><span class="s s25">  I know they seemed dangerous
as late as 2001, because I wrote an
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/road.html">
    essay
   </a>
   then 
about how they were
less dangerous than they seemed.</span>   <span class="s s26">I'd guess they were dead by 2005.</span>
<span class="s s27">I know when we started Y Combinator we didn't worry about Microsoft
as competition for the startups we funded.</span>  <span class="s s28">In fact, we've never
even invited them to the demo days we organize for startups to
present to investors.</span>  <span class="s s29">We invite Yahoo and Google and some other
Internet companies, but we've never bothered to invite Microsoft.</span>
<span class="s s30">Nor has anyone there ever even sent us an email.</span>  <span class="s s31">They're in a
different world.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s33">
   What killed them?  Four things, I think, all of them occurring
simultaneously in the mid 2000s.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s34">The most obvious is Google.</span>  <span class="s s35">There can only be one big man in town,
and they're clearly it.</span>  <span class="s s36">Google is the most dangerous company
now by far, in both the good and bad senses of the word.</span><span class="s s37">  Microsoft
can at best
   <a target="_blank" href="http://live.com">
    limp
   </a>
   along afterward.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s39">When did Google take the lead?</span>  <span class="s s40">There will be a tendency to push
it back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren't setting the
terms of the debate then.</span>  <span class="s s41">I'd say they took the lead in
2005.</span>  <span class="s s42">Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge.</span>
<span class="s s43">Gmail showed they could do more than search.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s45">Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software,
if you took advantage of what later came to be called "Ajax.</span><span class="s s46">"</span> <span class="s s47">And
that was the second cause of Microsoft's death: everyone can see the
desktop is over.</span><span class="s s48">  It now seems inevitable that applications will
live on the web&acirc;&#128;&#148;not just email, but everything, right up to
   <a target="_blank" href="http://snipshot.com">
    Photoshop
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s49">Even Microsoft sees that now.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax.</span>  <span class="s s52">The x
in Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser
communicate with the server in the background while displaying a page.</span>
<span class="s s53">(Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to 
ask for a new page.</span><span class="s s54">) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s
because they needed it for Outlook.</span>  <span class="s s55">What they didn't realize was
that it would be useful to a lot of other people too&acirc;&#128;&#148;in fact, to
anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s57">The other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programming
language that runs in the browser.</span>  <span class="s s58">Microsoft saw the danger of
Javascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could.</span><span class="s s59">

   </a>
   ]
                           
                           But eventually the open source world won, by producing
Javascript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorer
the way a tree grows over barbed wire.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s61">The third cause of Microsoft's death was broadband Internet.</span>  <span class="s s62">Anyone
who cares can have fast Internet access
now.</span>  <span class="s s63">And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need the
desktop.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s65">The last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple.</span>  
<span class="s s66">Thanks to OS X, Apple has come back from the dead in a way
that is extremely rare in technology.</span><span class="s s67">

                               Their victory is so complete that I'm now surprised when I come across
a computer running Windows.</span>  <span class="s s68">Nearly all the people we fund at Y
Combinator use Apple laptops.</span><span class="s s69">  It was the same in the audience at

   .</span>  <span class="s s70">All the computer people use Macs or Linux now.</span>  <span class="s s71">Windows is for
grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s.</span>  <span class="s s72">So not only does the
desktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses
Microsoft's anyway.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s74">
   And of course Apple has Microsoft on the run in music
too, with TV and phones on the way.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s75">I'm glad Microsoft is dead.</span>  <span class="s s76">They were like Nero or 
Commodus&acirc;&#128;&#148;evil
in the way only inherited power can make you.</span>  <span class="s s77">Because remember,
the Microsoft monopoly didn't begin with Microsoft.</span>  <span class="s s78">They got it
from IBM.</span>  <span class="s s79">The software business was overhung by a
monopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005.</span>  <span class="s s80">For practically
its whole existence, that is.</span>  <span class="s s81">One of the reasons "Web 2.</span><span class="s s82">0" has
such an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not,
that this era of monopoly may finally be over.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s84">Of course, as a hacker I can't help thinking about how something
broken could be fixed.</span>  <span class="s s85">Is there some way Microsoft could come back?</span>
<span class="s s86">In principle, yes.</span>  <span class="s s87">To see how, envision two things: (a) the amount
of cash Microsoft now has on hand, and (b) Larry and Sergey making
the rounds of all the search engines ten years ago trying to sell
the idea for Google for a million dollars, and being turned down
by everyone.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s89">The surprising fact is, brilliant hackers&acirc;&#128;&#148;dangerously brilliant
hackers&acirc;&#128;&#148;can be had very cheaply, by the standards of a
company as rich as Microsoft.</span><span class="s s90">  They can't
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html">
    hire
   </a>
   smart people anymore,
but they could buy as many as they wanted for only an order of magnitude 
more.</span> <span class="s s91">So if they wanted to be a contender
again, this is how they could do it:</span>
   </p><ol><li><span class="s s92">
     Buy all the good "Web 2.0" startups.  They could get substantially
    all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.
    </span></li>
   </ol><p>
   </p><li><span class="s s93">
    Put them all in a building in Silicon Valley, surrounded by
    lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.
   </span></li><span class="s s94">
   I feel safe suggesting this, because they'd never do it.  Microsoft's
biggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they
suck.  They still think they can write software in house.  Maybe they
can, by the standards of the desktop world.  But that world ended
a few years ago.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s95">I already know what the reaction to this essay will be.</span>  <span class="s s96">Half the
readers will say that Microsoft is still an enormously profitable
company, and that I should be more
careful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think
in our insular little "Web 2.</span><span class="s s97">0" bubble.</span>  <span class="s s98">The other half, the younger
half, will complain that this is old news.</span>

It doesn't take a conscious effort to make software incompatible.

you're a big company, you produce in copious quantities.  The
