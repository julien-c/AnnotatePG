    Now that the term "ramen profitable" has become widespread, I ought
to explain precisely what the idea entails.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s4">Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.</span>  <span class="s s5">This is a different form of profitability
than startups have traditionally aimed for.</span>  <span class="s s6">Traditional profitability
means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance
of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.</span><span class="s s7">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s8">In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only
after raising and spending quite a lot of money.</span>  <span class="s s9">A company making
computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, during
which they spent $50 million.</span>  <span class="s s10">But when they did
they might have revenues of $50 million a year.</span>   <span class="s s11">This kind of
profitability means the startup has succeeded.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s13">Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes
profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000
a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders
who can live on practically nothing.</span>  <span class="s s14">Revenues of $3000 a month do
not mean the company has succeeded.</span>
<span class="s s15">But it does share something with the one
that's profitable in the traditional way: they don't need to raise
money to survive.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s17">Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because
it only recently became feasible.</span>  <span class="s s18">It's still not feasible for a
lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for
example; but it is for many software startups because they're now
so cheap.</span>  <span class="s s19">For many, the only real cost is the founders'
living expenses.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s21">The main significance of this type of profitability is that you're
no longer at the mercy of investors.</span>  <span class="s s22">If you're still losing money,
then eventually you'll either have to raise more
or shut down.</span>  <span class="s s23">Once you're
ramen profitable this painful choice goes away.</span>
<span class="s s24">You can still raise money, but you don't have to do it now.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    </p><center><span class="s s26">
     * * *
    </span></center>
   
   <p>
    <span class="s s27">The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that
you can get better terms.  If investors know you need money, they'll
sometimes take advantage of you.</span>  <span class="s s28">Some may even deliberately
stall, because they know that as you run out of money you'll become
increasingly pliable.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability.</span>
<span class="s s31">One is that it makes you more attractive to investors.</span>  <span class="s s32">If you're
already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you
can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you're serious about
building things people want, and (c) you're disciplined enough to
keep expenses low.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s34">This is reassuring to investors, because you've addressed three of
their biggest worries.</span>  <span class="s s35">It's common for them to fund companies that
have smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail.</span>  <span class="s s36">When
these companies fail, it's usually because (a) people wouldn't pay
for what they made, e.</span><span class="s s37">g.</span> <span class="s s38">because it was too hard to sell to them,
or the market wasn't ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong
problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c)
the company spent too much and burned through their funding before
they started to make money.</span>  <span class="s s39">If you're ramen profitable, you're
already avoiding these mistakes.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s41">Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it's good for
morale.</span>  <span class="s s42">A company
tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it.</span>  <span class="s s43">It's
legally a company, but you feel like you're lying when you call it
one.</span>  <span class="s s44">When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company
starts to feel real.</span>  <span class="s s45">And your own living expenses are the milestone
you feel most, because at that point the future flips state.</span>  <span class="s s46">Now
survival is the default, instead of dying.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s48">A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because
the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard.</span>  <span class="s s49">Startups
are still very rare.</span>  <span class="s s50">Why don't more people do it?</span>  <span class="s s51">The financial
risk?</span>  <span class="s s52">Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway.</span>  <span class="s s53">The long hours?</span>
<span class="s s54">Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs.</span> <span class="s s55">What keeps
people from starting startups is the fear of having so much
responsibility.</span>  <span class="s s56">And this is not an irrational fear: it really is
hard to bear.</span>  <span class="s s57">Anything that takes some of that weight off you will 
greatly increase your chances of surviving.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely
to succeed than not.</span>  <span class="s s60">Which is pretty exciting, considering the
bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or
make a lot of money.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s62">The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious
but may be the most important.</span>  <span class="s s63">If you don't need to raise money,
you don't have to interrupt working on the company to do it.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s65">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/fundraising.html">
     Raising money
    </a>
    is terribly distracting.</span>  
<span class="s s66">You're lucky if your
productivity is a third of what it was before.</span>  <span class="s s67">And it can last for
months.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s69">I didn't understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising
money was so distracting till earlier this year.</span>  <span class="s s70">I'd noticed that
startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched
to raising money, but I didn't remember exactly why till YC raised
money itself.</span>  <span class="s s71">We had a comparatively easy time of it; the first
people I asked said yes; but it took months to work out the
details, and during that time I got hardly any real work done.</span>  <span class="s s72">Why?</span>
<span class="s s73">Because I thought about it all the time.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">At any given time there tends to be one problem that's the most
urgent for a startup.</span>  <span class="s s76">This is what you think about as you fall
asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning.</span>  <span class="s s77">And
when you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think
about.</span>  <span class="s s78">You only take one shower in the morning, and if you're
thinking about investors during it, then you're not thinking about
the product.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s80">Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a time
when you're not in the middle of something else, and you can probably
also insist that the round close fast.</span>  <span class="s s81">You may even be able to
avoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don't care
whether it closes.</span>

   <p>
    <span class="s s84">Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies.</span>  <span class="s s85">It
does not, for example, imply that you're "bootstrapping" the
startup&mdash;that you're never going to take money from investors.</span>
<span class="s s86">Empirically that doesn't seem to work very well.</span>  <span class="s s87">Few startups
succeed without taking investment.</span>  <span class="s s88">Maybe as startups get cheaper
it will become more common.</span>  <span class="s s89">On the other hand, the money is there,
waiting to be invested.</span>  <span class="s s90">If startups need it less, they'll be able
to get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined to
take it.</span>  <span class="s s91">That will tend to produce an equilibrium.</span><span class="s s92">

    Another thing ramen profitability doesn't imply is Joe Kraus's idea
that you should put your
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/30/joe-kraus-confessions-of-a-startup-addict/">
     business model
    </a>
    in beta when you put your
product in beta.</span>  <span class="s s94">He believes you should get
people to pay you from the beginning.</span>  <span class="s s95">I think that's too constraining.</span>
<span class="s s96">Facebook didn't, and they've done better than most startups.</span>  <span class="s s97">Making
money right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probably
would have been harmful.</span>  <span class="s s98">I do think Joe's rule could be useful for
many startups, though.</span>  <span class="s s99">When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes
suggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in the
hope that this constraint will prod them into action.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s101">The difference between Joe's idea and ramen profitability is that
a ramen profitable company doesn't have to be making money the way
it ultimately will.</span>  <span class="s s102">It just has to be making money.</span>  <span class="s s103">The most
famous example is Google, which initially made money by licensing
search to sites like Yahoo.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">Is there a downside to ramen profitability?</span>  <span class="s s106">Probably the biggest
danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm.</span>  <span class="s s107">Startups
have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing
that everyone uses.</span>  <span class="s s108">The defining quality of startups is that they
grow fast, and consulting just can't scale the way a product can.</span><span class="s s109">
                                                    
                                                     [

                                                    But it's pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; in
fact, that would be a low rate for contract programming.</span>  <span class="s s110">So there
could be a temptation to slide into consulting, and telling
yourselves you're a ramen profitable startup, when in fact
you're not a startup at all.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s112">It's ok to do a little consulting-type work at first.</span>  <span class="s s113">Startups
usually have to do something weird at first.</span>  <span class="s s114">But remember
that ramen profitability is not the destination.</span><span class="s s115">  A startup's
destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick

The "ramen" in "ramen profitable" refers to instant ramen,
which is just about the cheapest food available.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s120">Please do not take the term literally.</span>  <span class="s s121">Living on instant ramen
would be very unhealthy.</span>  <span class="s s122">Rice and beans are a better source of
food.</span>  <span class="s s123">Start by investing in a rice cooker, if you don't have one.</span>

  3n cloves garlic
  n 12-oz cans white, kidney, or black beans
  n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon
  n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
  3n teaspoons ground cumin
  n cups dry rice, preferably brown</span>
    </pre><span class="s s127">
    Put rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package.
(Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and
forget about it.

    <span class="s s128">Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil, over fairly low
heat, till onions are glassy.</span> <span class="s s129">Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin,
and a little more fat, and stir.</span>  <span class="s s130">Keep heat low.</span> <span class="s s131">Cook another 2 or
3 minutes, then add beans (don't drain the beans), and stir.</span> <span class="s s132">Throw
in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least
10 minutes more.</span> <span class="s s133">Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s135">If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount
stores.</span>  <span class="s s136">Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk.</span>
<span class="s s137">If there's an Indian grocery store near you, they'll have big 
bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets.</span>

There's a good chance that a shift in power from investors
to founders would actually increase the size of the venture business.</span>
<span class="s s140">I think investors currently err too far on the side of being harsh
to founders.</span>  <span class="s s141">If they were forced to stop, the whole venture business
would work better, and you might see something like the increase
in trade you always see when restrictive laws are removed.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s143">Investors
are one of the biggest sources of pain for founders; if they stopped
causing so much pain, it would be better to be a founder; and if
it were better to be a founder, more people would do it.</span>

It's conceivable that a startup could grow big by transforming
consulting into a form that would scale.</span>  <span class="s s146">But if they did that
they'd really be a product company.</span>
