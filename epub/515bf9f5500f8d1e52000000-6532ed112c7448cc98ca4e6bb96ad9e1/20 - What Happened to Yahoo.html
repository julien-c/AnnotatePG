   What Happened to Yahoo

   <p>
    <span class="s s3">When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998,
it felt like the center of the world.</span>  <span class="s s4">It was supposed to be the
next big thing.</span>  <span class="s s5">It was supposed to be what Google turned out to
be.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s7">What went wrong?</span>  <span class="s s8">The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,
practically to the beginning of the company.</span>  <span class="s s9">They were already
very visible when I got there in 1998.</span>  <span class="s s10">Yahoo had two problems
Google didn't: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology
company.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s12">
    Money
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s13">The first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for
different reasons.</span>  <span class="s s14">He thought we were meeting so he could check
us out in person before buying us.</span> <span class="s s15">I thought we were meeting so we
could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop.</span>   <span class="s s16">It was a way of
sorting shopping search results.</span>  <span class="s s17">Merchants bid a percentage of
sales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but
by the bid times the average amount a user would buy.</span>  <span class="s s18">It was
like the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the
spring of 1998, before Google was founded.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s20">Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense
that it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from
each link.</span>  <span class="s s21">But it wasn't just optimal in that sense.</span>  <span class="s s22">Ranking
search results by user behavior also makes search better.</span>  <span class="s s23">Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s25">Jerry didn't seem to care.</span>  <span class="s s26">I was confused.</span>  <span class="s s27">I was showing him
technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,
and he didn't care?</span>  <span class="s s28">I couldn't tell whether I was explaining it
badly, or he was just very poker faced.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s30">I didn't realize the answer till later, after I went to work at
Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s31">It was neither of my guesses.</span>  <span class="s s32">The reason Yahoo didn't care
about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that
advertisers were already overpaying for it.</span>  <span class="s s33">If they merely extracted
the actual value, they'd have made less.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads.</span>
<span class="s s36">Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads.</span>
<span class="s s37">So Yahoo's sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.</span>
<span class="s s38">Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,
Yahoo's sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and come back
with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s40">The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers,
for lack of any other reference, compared them to.</span>  <span class="s s41">But they were
expensive compared to what they were worth.</span>  <span class="s s42">So these big, dumb
companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on.</span>  <span class="s s43">But
there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s45">By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.</span>
<span class="s s46">Investors were excited about the Internet.</span>  <span class="s s47">One reason they were
excited was Yahoo's revenue growth.</span>  <span class="s s48">So they invested in new Internet
startups.</span>  <span class="s s49">The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to
get traffic.</span>  <span class="s s50">Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and
further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.</span>
<span class="s s51">When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up
like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of "Eureka!</span><span class="s s52">"</span> <span class="s s53">I was
shouting "Sell!</span><span class="s s54">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">Both the Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing
brand advertising.</span>  <span class="s s57">They didn't care about targeting.</span>  <span class="s s58">They just
wanted lots of people to see their ads.</span>  <span class="s s59">So traffic became the thing
to get at Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s60">It didn't matter what type.</span><span class="s s61">

   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s62">It wasn't just Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s63">All the search engines were doing it.</span>  <span class="s s64">This
was why they were trying to get people to start calling them "portals"
instead of "search engines.</span><span class="s s65">"</span> <span class="s s66">Despite the actual meaning of the word
portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find
what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through
on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s68">I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo
should buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers in
the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search.</span>  <span class="s s69">He told me
that it wasn't worth worrying about.</span>  <span class="s s70">Search was only 6% of our
traffic, and we were growing at 10% a month.</span>   <span class="s s71">It wasn't worth doing
better.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s73">I didn't say "But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!</span><span class="s s74">"</span>
<span class="s s75">I said "Oh, ok.</span><span class="s s76">"</span>  <span class="s s77">Because I didn't realize either how much search
traffic was worth.</span>  <span class="s s78">I'm not sure even Larry and Sergey did then.</span>
<span class="s s79">If they had, Google presumably wouldn't have expended any effort
on enterprise search.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s81">If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might
have realized sooner how important search was.</span>  <span class="s s82">But they had the
most opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.</span>
<span class="s s83">As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was
hard to take search seriously.</span>  <span class="s s84">Google didn't have that to distract
them.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s86">
    Hackers
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s87">But Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to change
directions.</span>  <span class="s s88">They'd been thrown off balance from the start by their
ambivalence about being a technology company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s90">One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there
was the way they insisted on calling themselves a "media company.</span><span class="s s91">"</span>
<span class="s s92">If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a software
company.</span>  <span class="s s93">The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product
managers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people
(yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart
their browsers, and so on, just like a software company.</span>  <span class="s s94">So why
did they call themselves a media company?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s96">One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads.</span>  <span class="s s97">In 1995
it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.</span>
<span class="s s98">Technology companies made money by selling their software to users.</span>
<span class="s s99">Media companies sold ads.</span>  <span class="s s100">So they must be a media company.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s102">Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft.</span>   <span class="s s103">If anyone at Yahoo
considered the idea that they should be a technology company, the
next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">It's hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear
Microsoft still inspired in 1995.</span>  <span class="s s106">Imagine a company with several
times the power Google has now, but way meaner.</span>  <span class="s s107">It was perfectly
reasonable to be afraid of them.</span>  <span class="s s108">Yahoo watched them crush the first
hot Internet company, Netscape.</span>  <span class="s s109">It was reasonable to worry that
if they tried to be the next Netscape, they'd suffer the same fate.</span>
<span class="s s110">How were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft's
last victim?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s112">It would have been a clever move to pretend to be a media company
to throw Microsoft off their scent.</span>  <span class="s s113">But unfortunately Yahoo actually
tried to be one, sort of.</span>  <span class="s s114">Project managers at Yahoo were called
"producers," for example, and the different parts of the company
were called "properties.</span><span class="s s115">"</span> <span class="s s116">But what Yahoo really needed to be was a
technology company, and by trying to be something else, they ended
up being something that was neither here nor there.</span>  <span class="s s117">That's why
Yahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s119">The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they
didn't take programming seriously enough.</span>  <span class="s s120">Microsoft (back in the
day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.</span>
<span class="s s121">But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity.</span>  <span class="s s122">At Yahoo, user-facing software
was controlled by product managers and designers.</span>  <span class="s s123">The job of
programmers was just to take the work of the product managers and
designers the final step, by translating it into code.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s125">One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things,
they often weren't very good.</span> <span class="s s126">But that wasn't the worst problem.</span>
<span class="s s127">The worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s129">Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all been
obsessed with hiring the best programmers.</span>  <span class="s s130">Yahoo wasn't.</span>  <span class="s s131">They
preferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn't have the
kind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring
the smartest people that the big winners have had.</span>  <span class="s s132">And when you
consider how much competition there was for programmers when they
were hiring, during the Bubble, it's not surprising that the quality
of their programmers was uneven.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s134">In technology, once you have bad programmers, you're doomed.</span>  <span class="s s135">I
can't think of an instance where a company has sunk into technical
mediocrity and recovered.</span> <span class="s s136">Good programmers want to work with other
good programmers.</span>  <span class="s s137">So once the quality of programmers at your company
starts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no
recovery.</span><span class="s s138">

    ]
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s139">At Yahoo this death spiral started early.</span>  <span class="s s140">If there was ever a time when
Yahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I
got there in 1998.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s142">The company felt prematurely old.</span>  <span class="s s143">Most technology companies
eventually get taken over by suits and middle managers.</span>  <span class="s s144">At Yahoo
it felt as if they'd deliberately accelerated this process.</span>  <span class="s s145">They
didn't want to be a bunch of hackers.</span>  <span class="s s146">They wanted to be suits.</span>  <span class="s s147">A
media company should be run by suits.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s149">The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, the
same number Yahoo had when I went to work there.</span>  <span class="s s150">But boy did things
seem different.</span>  <span class="s s151">It was still very much a hacker-centric culture.</span>
<span class="s s152">I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the
problem of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked
"what should we do?</span><span class="s s153">"</span>  <span class="s s154">Programmers at Yahoo wouldn't have asked that.</span>
<span class="s s155">Theirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what product
managers spec'd.</span>  <span class="s s156">I remember coming away from Google thinking "Wow,
it's still a startup.</span><span class="s s157">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s159">There's not much we can learn from Yahoo's first fatal flaw.</span> <span class="s s160">It's
probably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged by
depending on a bogus source of revenue.</span>  <span class="s s161">But startups can learn an
important lesson from the second one.</span>  <span class="s s162">In the software business,
you can't afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s164">Probably the most impressive commitment I've heard to having a
hacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at
Startup School in 2007.</span>  <span class="s s165">He said that in the early days Facebook
made a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that would not
ordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s167">So which companies need to have a hacker-centric culture?</span>  <span class="s s168">Which
companies are "in the software business" in this respect?</span>  <span class="s s169">As Yahoo
discovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most people
realize.</span>  <span class="s s170">The answer is: any company that needs to have good software.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s172">Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn't
have a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others that
did?</span>  <span class="s s173">I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,
or if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in it
were hacker-centric.</span>  <span class="s s174">Otherwise you can't attract good programmers
to work in a suit-centric culture.</span>  <span class="s s175">And without good programmers
you won't get good software, no matter how many people you put on
a task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure "quality.</span><span class="s s176">"</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s178">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/gba.html">
     Hacker culture
    </a>
    often seems kind of irresponsible.</span>  <span class="s s179">That's why people
proposing to destroy it use phrases like "adult supervision.</span><span class="s s180">"</span> <span class="s s181">That
was the phrase they used at Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s182">But there are worse things than
seeming irresponsible.</span>  <span class="s s183">Losing, for example.</span>

In theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good
programmers instead of hiring them.</span>  <span class="s s191">You can get programmers
who would never have come to you as employees by buying their 
startups.</span> <span class="s s192">But so far the only companies smart enough
to do this are companies smart enough not to need to.</span>
