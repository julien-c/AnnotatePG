   <!--At the end of each day I save a copy of whatever I'm working on.
I thought it would be interesting to compare a finished
essay with the first version to see how much of the original  
text survives.
--><span class="s s3">
   As E. B. White said, "good writing is rewriting."  I didn't
realize this when I was in school.  In writing, as in math and 
science, they only show you the finished product.
You don't see all the false starts.  This gives students a
misleading view of how things get made.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s4">Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want   
people to see their mistakes.</span>  <span class="s s5">But I'm willing to let people
see an early draft if it will show how much you have
to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.</span>

   Below is the oldest version I can find of

    The Age of the Essay

   (probably the second or third day), with
text that ultimately survived in
           
            red
           
           and text that later
got deleted in
           
            gray
           
           .</span>
<span class="s s8">There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong,
things that seem like bragging, flames,
digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">I discarded more from the beginning.</span>  <span class="s s11">That's
not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.</span>  <span class="s s12">There
are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where
I'm heading.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">The amount of cutting is about average.</span>  <span class="s s15">I probably write
three to four words for every one that appears in the final
version of an essay.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s17">(Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, remember
that anything you see here that's not in the final version is obviously
something I chose not to publish, often because I disagree
with it.</span><span class="s s18">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s19">Recently a friend said that what he liked about
my essays was that they weren't written the way
we'd been taught to write essays in school.</span>  <span class="s s20">You
remember:
                      
                       topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.</span>
                      
                      <span class="s s21">It hadn't
occurred to me till then that those horrible things
we had to write in school were even connected to
what I was doing now.</span>  <span class="s s22">But sure enough, I thought,
they did call them "essays," didn't they?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s24">Well, they're not.</span>  <span class="s s25">Those things you have to write
in school are not only not essays, they're one of the
most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have
to jump through in school.</span>  <span class="s s26">And I worry that they
not only teach students the wrong things about writing,
but put them off writing entirely.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what
an essay really is, and how you write one.</span>  <span class="s s29">Or at least,
how I write one.</span>
                          
                          <span class="s s30">Students be forewarned: if you actually write
the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad
grades.</span>  <span class="s s31">But knowing how it's really done should
at least help you to understand the feeling of futility
you have when you're writing the things they tell you to.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s33">The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.</span>
                            
                            <span class="s s34">It's a fine thing for schools to
                            
                             teach students how to
write.</span>
                            
                            <span class="s s35">But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre
reason that I'll explain in a moment),
                            
                             the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.</span>  <span class="s s36">And so all over the country, students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget 
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s38">With
                              
                              obvious
                              
                               result
                              
                              s.</span>  <span class="s s39">Only a few people really
                              
                               care about
symbolism in Dickens.</span>
                              
                              <span class="s s40">The teacher doesn't.</span>
<span class="s s41">The students don't.</span>  <span class="s s42">Most of the people who've had to write PhD
disserations about Dickens don't.</span>  <span class="s s43">And certainly
                              
                               Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s45">How did things get this way?</span>  <span class="s s46">To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.</span>
                                
                               
                              
                              <span class="s s47">Between about 500 and 1000, life was
not very good in Europe.</span><span class="s s48">  The term "dark ages" is presently
out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn't dark; 
it was just
   <i>
    different
   </i>
   ), but if this label didn't already
exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor.</span>  <span class="s s49">What little
original thought there was took place in lulls between
constant wars and had something of the character of
the thoughts of parents with a new baby.</span>
<span class="s s50">The most amusing thing written during this
period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is,
I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s52">Around 1000
                                
                                 Europe began to catch its breath.</span>
<span class="s s53">And once they
had the luxury of curiosity,
                                
                                one of the first things they discovered
was
                                
                                 what we call "the classics.</span><span class="s s54">"</span>
                                
                                <span class="s s55">Imagine if
                                
                                 we were visited  
by
                                
                                aliens.</span>  <span class="s s56">If they could even get here they'd presumably know a
few things we don't.</span>  <span class="s s57">Immediately Alien Studies would become
the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly
discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up
everything they'd discovered.</span>  <span class="s s58">So it was in Europe in 1200.</span>
<span class="s s59">When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained
not just new answers, but new questions.</span>  <span class="s s60">(If anyone proved
a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there
is no record of it.</span><span class="s s61">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s62">For a couple centuries, some of the most important work
being done was intellectual archaelogy.</span>  <span class="s s63">Those were also
the centuries during which schools were first established.</span>
<span class="s s64">And since reading ancient texts was the
                                  
                                   essence of what
scholars did
                                  
                                  then, it became the basis of the curriculum.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s66">By 1700,
                                    
                                     someone who wanted to learn about
                                    
                                    physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek in order to read
                                    
                                     Aristotle.</span>  <span class="s s67">But schools
change slower than scholarship
                                    
                                    :
                                    
                                     the study of
ancient texts
                                    
                                    had such prestige that it remained
                                    
                                     the backbone of
                                    
                                    education
until the late 19th century.</span>  <span class="s s68">By then it was merely a tradition.</span>
<span class="s s69">It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult,
and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy;
it introduced students to
cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness
made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.</span>
<span class="s s70">But it certainly wasn't
true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that students were
serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s72">Classical scholarship had also changed.</span>  <span class="s s73">In the early era, philology
actually mattered.</span>  <span class="s s74">The texts that filtered into Europe were
all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and
copyists.</span>  <span class="s s75">Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said
before they could figure out what he meant.</span>  <span class="s s76">But by the modern
era such questions were answered as well as they were ever
going to be.</span>  <span class="s s77">And so the study of ancient texts became less
about ancientness and more about texts.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s79">The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?</span>  <span class="s s80">The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.</span>
<span class="s s81">But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.</span>
<span class="s s82">The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
the people studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s84">And so began the study of modern literature.</span> <span class="s s85">There was
                                          
                                         
                                        
                                        some
initial
                                        
                                         resistance
                                        
                                        , but it didn't last long.</span>
<span class="s s86">The limiting
reagent in the growth of university departments is what
parents will let undergraduates study.</span>  <span class="s s87">If parents will let
their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.</span>
<span class="s s88">There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them.</span>
<span class="s s89">The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish
one another's papers.</span>  <span class="s s90">Universities with x departments will
subscribe to the journals.</span>  <span class="s s91">Graduate students who want jobs
as professors of x will write dissertations about it.</span>  <span class="s s92">It may
take a good long while for the more prestigious universities
to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  but
at the other end of the scale there are so many universities
competing to attract students that the mere establishment of
a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s94">High schools imitate universities.</span>
                                          
                                          <span class="s s95">And so once university
English departments were established in the late nineteenth century,
                                          
                                           the 'riting component of the 3 Rs
                                          
                                          was
                                          
                                           morphed into English.</span>
<span class="s s96">With the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a
few decades before.</span>   <span class="s s97">It's no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s99">Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.</span>
<span class="s s100">The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, and
that could be taught better by itself.</span>  <span class="s s101">Students learn better
when they're interested in what they're doing, and it's hard
to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens.</span>
<span class="s s102">Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionally
are not really interested in it.</span>  <span class="s s103">(Though indeed, it's been a
while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're
writing about gender.</span><span class="s s104">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s105">I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will  
be adopted.</span>  <span class="s s106">Public schools probably couldn't stop teaching
English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by
law.</span>  <span class="s s107">But here's a related suggestion that goes with the grain
instead of against it: that universities establish a
writing major.</span>  <span class="s s108">Many of the students who now major in English
would major in writing if they could, and most would
be better off.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s110">It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be
exposed to their literary heritage.</span>  <span class="s s111">Certainly.</span>  <span class="s s112">But is that
more important than that they learn to write well?</span>  <span class="s s113">And are
English classes even the place to do it?</span>  <span class="s s114">After all,
the average public high school student gets zero exposure to  
his artistic heritage.</span>  <span class="s s115">No disaster results.</span>
<span class="s s116">The people who are interested in art learn about it for
themselves, and those who aren't don't.</span>  <span class="s s117">I find that American
adults are no better or worse informed about literature than
art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature
in high school and no time at all studying art.</span>  <span class="s s118">Which presumably
means that what they're taught in school is rounding error 
compared to what they pick up on their own.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s120">Indeed, English classes may even be harmful.</span>  <span class="s s121">In my case they
were effectively aversion therapy.</span>  <span class="s s122">Want to make someone dislike
a book?</span>  <span class="s s123">Force him to read it and write an essay about it.</span>
<span class="s s124">And make the topic so intellectually bogus that you
could not, if asked, explain why one ought to write about it.</span>
<span class="s s125">I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school
I never read the books we were assigned.</span>  <span class="s s126">I was so disgusted with
what we were doing that it became a point of honor
with me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students'
without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names
of the characters and a few random events in it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s128">I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same
problem there.</span>  <span class="s s129">It was not the teachers.</span>  <span class="s s130">It was English.</span>   
<span class="s s131">We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them.</span>
<span class="s s132">About what, and why?</span>  <span class="s s133">That no one seemed to be able to explain.</span>
<span class="s s134">Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher  
wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken
place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the
subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.</span>
<span class="s s135">One got extra credit for motives having to do with class,
as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and  
sexuality.</span>  <span class="s s136">I learned how to churn out such stuff well enough
to get an A, but I never took another English class.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s138">And the books we did these disgusting things to, like those
we mishandled in high school, I find still have black marks
against them in my mind.</span>  <span class="s s139">The one saving grace was that   
English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers like
Henry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway.</span>
<span class="s s140">One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether to
allow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn't work.</span>
<span class="s s141">Fields that are intellectually unsure of themselves rely on
a similar principle.</span>  <span class="s s142">Reading P.</span><span class="s s143">G.</span> <span class="s s144">Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or
Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like
serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before 
English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him.</span> <span class="s s145">[sh]
And so good writers (just you wait and see who's still in
print in 300 years) are less likely to have readers turned   
against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour guides.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s147">The other big difference between a real essay and the 
things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't 
take a position and then defend it.</span>  <span class="s s148">That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,   
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.</span>  <span class="s s149">It's often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.</span>  <span class="s s150">In fact they

thesis

a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.</span>

legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.</span>

That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.
The rest is a kind of midden that always accumulates at the
end of the file, consisting of notes to myself
and chunks of deleted text that I might (but never do) re-use later.These are the notes about what to work on the next morning.
(The percent sign is the LaTex comment character.)
Except for the beginning, I didn't write about what I expected to:

% not allowed to write about painting
% like nothing more than to be wrong-- because surprise

%  that violate the usual social conventions, much as surgeons

%  conventions.
% but not opinionated in the sense that I won't change my
%  opinions.  I love to be surprised, and to be surprised is
%  always to have been at least implicitly mistaken   
</pre>
This is the part I had to discard when I backtracked.
It used to follow the paragraph that ended with
"prescribed course."Because you're after answers, instead of just trying to
convince people of something, it's important to qualify
your conclusions precisely.  No scientist will be satisfied
to hear that you measured something and it was 12.7.
12.7 plus or minus what?  What's your experimental error?This is just as important for questions whose answers
aren't numbers.
And yet people rarely bother in ordinary
conversation, most scientists included.  Once people
switch over to talking about matters that aren't
"scientific"--- mere matters of opinion--- they pay
comparatively little attention to qualifying what they say.Oh, they <i>use</i> qualifiers.  Once kids
arrive in college they learn pretty quickly that proper
intellectuals qualify every statement with "perhaps"
or "almost."  But this kind of qualification is nothing more
than grammatical. Sometimes these automatically inserted
qualifications end up at odds with the statements they're
attached to, yielding comic results.
You find people saying that a certain writer is
"perhaps the greatest writer of the twentieth century."
That's a rather strong way to put something you're not sure
about.  Wouldn't it be better just to say "one of the best
writers of the twentieth century?"One of the only people I've ever met who really pays attention
to qualification is my friend Robert Morris.  His great
fear in life is to say something that's mistaken.  So whenever   
he says something, he pays as much attention to expressing
how sure he is of it as he does to what he's saying.  He
is a connoisseur of his own certainty, and has as many words
for expressing it as Eskimos have for snow.  This is how we
all ought to be.  Sticking a perfunctory perhaps onto
every statement may shield us from blame, but it tells the
reader nothing.  That's like the manufacturers of Q-Tips,
who to cover themselves print "do not insert in ear canal" on the
boxes, when they know damned well that that's how Q-Tips are used.One of the most important things to know about
painting is that darks make the light.  This is particularly
obvious in watercolor.  Suppose you want to make a painting
that seems glowing with light.  Well, you can't get any
brighter than the white of the paper.  So the only way to
make the make the painting bright is to add darks
that make the lights seem brighter by contrast.  Without
darks, the painting won't seem bright; it will just seem
washed out.Some books about writing say that you shouldn't begin
sentences with "I think."  If you're saying something,
the argument does, then obviously you think it, so why
bother telling people?  This is nonsense.  The heavily qualified
statements in an essay play the role of darks.  When you
reach a point you're really sure of, you can just state it with no
qualifications, and it will have all the more force by contrast.People aren't used to
unqualified statements.  Without the automatic "perhaps"
they're used to seeing, many realize, with a shock,   
that what they're reading are <i>opinions.</i>
Well of course.  And what essay consists of anything else?
An essay is not a theorem.
You don't have to say only things you can prove irrefutably.
Don't be afraid of expressing your opinions.  Just make sure
you're right.
Miscellaneous smaller cuts:The downside is that essays may contain mistakes (though
so can theorems).  The upside is that you can talk aboutmore things.The world is not divided into the "scientific" and the
"subjective."  Scientific is a matter of degree.  And there
are plenty of questions that would be impractical to
answer by a controlled experiment and yet which are
worth discussing.  Indeed, some of the most interesting
questions are of this type.To mathematicians, the work of physicists seems rather
speculative.But if they're less precise, they can talk about a broader
range of subjects.Sometimes I feel tempted to
add a disclaimer to the beginning of my essays saying,
if you're bothered by unqualified statements, just stick  
the "perhaps" that you're used to seeing before each one.
I mean the same thing.Don't expect people to thank you for delivering these  
valuable facts to them, though---any more than they would
thank you for giving them steamed vegetables for dinner.
More notes about topics I intended to cover:
<pre>
% people will get angry, accuse you of making unsupported statements
% mere opinions
%  as if problem was structure, not content
% whole question of qualification, support
% all the good writers seem to be english
% practically the algorithm for life: look for anomalies
% actually start the one about the role of color in fashion 
% try to write sound bites
% length kind of arbitrary, based on human reader,
%  not needs of topic
</pre>I don't know O'Reilly's street address,
but it's probably not going to surprise me.  Surprises areWhat's so important about surprises?  They're the truth
you didn't already know.An essay must at least explore conclusions, even if
this offends people.  And the disconcerting thing is,
merely exploring ideas does offend people.
Readers used to defend-a-position
writing tend to get as angry with you for saying
"let's explore the possibility that x" as if you had
said "I believe x."  Indeed, some writers use the former
as nothing more than a learned sounding replacement for
the latter.  But in a proper essay,But when I want to say x I just say it.That sort of thing isn't really an essay either, though
it begins like one.I'm too afraid of real live readers to pull that sort of
thing.fuzzy treatments of controversial topics
that begin with interesting questions, retreat in terror
from thenature of newsmagazines means that such essays always start
with the most controversial questions.Real live readers won't stand for this.   In fact, they're
often made to stand for it.  I've noticed plenty of "essays"
that peter out in this way.Their resistance
gives the essay half its shape.Writing well is an extremely valuable skill.  In part
because to do it you have to think well.By the late 19th century, the era in which the study of ancient
texts had been the hottest area of scholarship was a
distant memory.  But the classics still had enormous prestige.
The problems posed by the ancientness part had been mostly
solved, or solved as well as they were going to be.  And so
what was leftthe people doing it hardly
remembered why it had originally been done.We think of the classics as tidy little red and green volumes
from the Loeb Library.From Islamic civilizations,
which were at that time far ahead in matters of scholarship,
they got Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy.
different Europe: what entered in 500 was the rump of the
western Roman empire, and what emerged in 1000 was a
civilization centered as much in northern Europe as in
Italy.misleading to talk about "Europe"From this
period date the oldest surviving institutionsbecause university admissions were
limited to children whose parents were willing to pay for them
to spend ten years studying ancient languages.(I'm not saying that new disciplines have no content.
I'm just saying that that isn't necessary.)
These appear to the the original notes I started with.  
I don't usually write more than this before I start. 
I never got to half the topics I meant to cover,
because the focus switched from prose to ideas.
