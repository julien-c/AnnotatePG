   Where to See Silicon Valley
  </span></h1>
  <h2>
   </h2><p><span class="s s2">
    October 2010
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">Silicon Valley proper is mostly suburban sprawl.</span>  <span class="s s4">At first glance
it doesn't seem there's anything to see.</span>  <span class="s s5">It's not the sort of place
that has conspicuous monuments.</span>  <span class="s s6">But if you look, there are subtle
signs you're in a place that's different from other places.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s8">
    1.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanford+university">
     Stanford
University
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">Stanford is a strange place.</span>  <span class="s s10">Structurally it is to an ordinary
university what suburbia is to a city.</span>  <span class="s s11">It's enormously spread out,
and feels surprisingly empty much of the time.</span>  <span class="s s12">But notice the
weather.</span>  <span class="s s13">It's probably perfect.</span>  <span class="s s14">And notice the beautiful mountains
to the west.</span>  <span class="s s15">And though you can't see it, cosmopolitan San Francisco
is 40 minutes to the north.</span>  <span class="s s16">That combination is much of the reason
Silicon Valley grew up around this university and not some other
one.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s18">
    2.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=university+and+ramona+palo+alto">
     University
Ave
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s19">A surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafes
on or just off University Ave in Palo Alto.</span>  <span class="s s20">If you visit on a
weekday between 10 and 5, you'll often see founders pitching
investors.</span>  <span class="s s21">In case you can't tell, the founders are the ones leaning
forward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back with
slightly pained expressions.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s23">
    3.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=165+university+ave+palo+alto">
     The Lucky
Office
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s24">The office at 165 University Ave was Google's first.</span>  <span class="s s25">Then it was
Paypal's.</span><span class="s s26">  (Now it's
    <a target="_blank" href="http://wepay.com">
     Wepay
    </a>
    's.</span><span class="s s27">)  The interesting thing about it is
the location.</span>  <span class="s s28">It's a smart move to put a startup in a place with
restaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,
because then the people who work there want to stay there, instead
of fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end.</span>  <span class="s s29">They go out
for dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back and
implement them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s31">It's important to realize that Google's current location in an
office park is not where they started; it's just where they were
forced to move when they needed more space.</span>  <span class="s s32">Facebook was till
recently across the street, till they too had to move because they
needed more space.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s34">

    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=old+palo+alto">
     Old
Palo Alto
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">Palo Alto was not originally a suburb.</span>  <span class="s s36">For the first 100 years or
so of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside.</span>
<span class="s s37">Then in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia that
raced down the peninsula.</span>  <span class="s s38">But Palo Alto north of Oregon expressway
still feels noticeably different from the area around it.</span>  <span class="s s39">It's one
of the nicest places in the Valley.</span>  <span class="s s40">The buildings are old (though
increasingly they are being torn down and replaced with generic
McMansions) and the trees are tall.</span>  <span class="s s41">But houses are very
expensive&acirc;&#128;&#148;around $1000 per square foot.</span> <span class="s s42">This is post-exit
Silicon Valley.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s44">
    5.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2900+sand+hill+road+menlo+park">
     Sand
Hill Road
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s45">It's interesting to see the VCs' offices on the north side of Sand
Hill Road precisely because they're so boringly uniform.</span>  <span class="s s46">The
buildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors express
very little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.</span>  <span class="s s47">(I've been
visiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.</span><span class="s s48">) It's
not a coincidence.</span>  <span class="s s49">These buildings are a pretty accurate reflection
of the VC business.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s51">If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meet
VCs.</span> <span class="s s52">But mostly you won't see anyone; bustling is the last word
you'd use to describe the atmos.</span>  <span class="s s53">Visiting Sand Hill Road reminds
you that the opposite of "down and dirty" would be "up and clean.</span><span class="s s54">"</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s56">
    6.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=castro+and+villa+mountain+view">
     Castro
Street
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s57">It's a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should be
considered the heart of the Valley now.</span>  <span class="s s58">University Ave would have
been 10 years ago.</span>  <span class="s s59">But Palo Alto is getting expensive.</span>  <span class="s s60">Increasingly
startups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a place
they come to meet investors.</span><span class="s s61">  Palo Alto has a lot of different
cafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/ca/mountain-view/castro-st/201/-red-rock-coffee">
     Red
Rock
    </a>
    .</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s63">
    7.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=charleston+road+mountain+view">
     Google
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s64">Google spread out from its first building in Mountain View 
to a lot of the surrounding ones.</span>  <span class="s s65">But because the
buildings were built at different times by different people,
the place doesn't have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typical
large company's headquarters have.</span>  <span class="s s66">It definitely has a flavor of
its own though.</span>  <span class="s s67">You sense there is something afoot.</span>  <span class="s s68">The general
atmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people who
look like they drive them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s70">You can't get into Google unless you know someone there.</span>  <span class="s s71">It's very
much worth seeing inside if you can, though.</span>   <span class="s s72">Ditto for Facebook,
at the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothing
to see outside.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s74">
    8.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=skylonda">
     Skyline
Drive
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s75">Skyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains.</span>  <span class="s s76">On
one side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea&acirc;&#128;&#148;which
because it's cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisingly
little role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering how
close it is.</span>  <span class="s s77">Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees are
huge redwoods, and in others they're live oaks.</span>  <span class="s s78">Redwoods mean those
are the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoods
condense rain out of fog.</span><span class="s s79">  The MROSD manages a collection of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openspace.org/">
     great walking trails
    </a>
    off
Skyline.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s81">
    9.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=interstate+280+san+mateo">
     280
    </a>
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s82">Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, which
is pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highways
in the world.</span>  <span class="s s83">I always take 280 when I have a choice.</span>  <span class="s s84">Notice the
long narrow lake to the west?</span> <span class="s s85">That's the San Andreas Fault.</span>  <span class="s s86">It
runs along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through Portola
Valley.</span><span class="s s87">  One of the MROSD trails runs
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_los_trancos.asp">
     right along
the fault
    </a>
    .</span>  <span class="s s88">A string of rich neighborhoods runs along the
foothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos
Hills, Saratoga, Los Gatos.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s90">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38037974@N00/3890299362/">
     SLAC
    </a>
    goes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road.</span><span class="s s91">  And a couple miles south of that is the Valley's equivalent of the "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign:

   <h3><span class="s s93">
    Notes
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s94">
    I skipped the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">
     Computer
History Museum
    </a>
    because this is a list of where to see the Valley
itself, not where to see artifacts from it.</span>  <span class="s s95">I also skipped San
Jose.</span>  <span class="s s96">San Jose calls itself the capital of Silicon Valley, but
when people in the Valley use the phrase "the city," they mean San
Francisco.</span>  <span class="s s97">San Jose is a dotted line on a map.</span>
