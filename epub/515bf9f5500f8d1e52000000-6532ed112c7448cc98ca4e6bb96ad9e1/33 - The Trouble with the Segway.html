   The Trouble with the Segway
  </span></h1>

  <p>
   <span class="s s3">The Segway hasn't delivered on its initial promise, to put it mildly.</span>
<span class="s s4">There are several reasons why, but one is that people don't want
to be seen riding them.</span> <span class="s s5">Someone riding a Segway looks like a dork.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s7">
   My friend Trevor Blackwell built
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tlb.org/scooter.html">
    his own Segway
   </a>
   , 
which we called
the Segwell.</span><span class="s s8"> He also built a one-wheeled version,
   <a target="_blank" href="http://tlb.org/eunicycle.html">
    the Eunicycle
   </a>
   ,
which looks exactly like a regular unicycle till you realize the
rider isn't pedaling.</span>  <span class="s s9">He has ridden them both to downtown Mountain
View to get coffee.</span>  <span class="s s10">When he rides the Eunicycle, people smile at
him.</span>  <span class="s s11">But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from their
cars: "Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo?</span><span class="s s12">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">Why do Segways provoke this reaction?</span><span class="s s15">  The reason you look like a
dork riding a Segway is that you look
   <i>
    smug
   </i>
   .</span>  <span class="s s16">You don't seem to
be working hard enough.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s18">Someone riding a motorcycle isn't working any harder.</span> <span class="s s19">But because
he's sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort.</span>  <span class="s s20">When
you're riding a Segway you're just standing there.</span>  <span class="s s21">And someone who's
being whisked along while seeming to do no work&mdash;someone in a sedan
chair, for example&mdash;can't help but look smug.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s23">Try this thought experiment and it becomes clear: imagine something
that worked like the Segway, but that you rode with one foot in
front of the other, like a skateboard.</span>  <span class="s s24">That wouldn't seem nearly
as uncool.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">So there may be a way to capture more of the market Segway hoped
to reach: make a version that doesn't look so easy for the rider.</span>
<span class="s s27">It would also be helpful if the styling was in the tradition of
skateboards or bicycles rather than medical devices.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s29">Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that the
company was itself a kind of Segway.</span>  <span class="s s30">It was too easy for them;
they were too successful raising money.</span>  <span class="s s31">If they'd had to grow the
company gradually, by iterating through several versions they sold
to real users, they'd have learned pretty quickly that people looked
stupid riding them.</span> <span class="s s32">Instead they had enough to work in secret.</span>  <span class="s s33">They
had focus groups aplenty, I'm sure, but they didn't have the people
yelling insults out of cars.</span>  <span class="s s34">So they never realized they were
zooming confidently down a blind alley.</span>
