    What the Bubble Got Right

    September 2004
   </span></p>
   <p><span class="s s3">
    <i>
     (This essay is derived from an invited talk at ICFP 2004.)
    </i>
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s4">I had a front row seat for the Internet Bubble,
because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999.</span>  <span class="s s5">One day,
when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated
what I thought the price should be.</span> <span class="s s6">The 
answer I got was $12.</span>  <span class="s s7">I went to
the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor.</span>  <span class="s s8">"Twelve!</span><span class="s s9">"</span> <span class="s s10">he said.</span>
<span class="s s11">He tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it.</span>  <span class="s s12">He
knew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s14">Yahoo was a special case.</span>  <span class="s s15">It was not just our price to earnings
ratio that was bogus.</span>  <span class="s s16">Half our earnings were too.</span>  <span class="s s17">Not in
the Enron way, of course.</span>  <span class="s s18">The finance guys seemed
scrupulous about reporting earnings.</span>  <span class="s s19">What made our
earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of
a Ponzi scheme.</span>  <span class="s s20">Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings
and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make
money.</span>  <span class="s s21">So they invested in new
startups that promised to be the next Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s22">And as soon as these startups
got the money, what did they do with it?</span>
<span class="s s23">Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote
their brand.</span>  <span class="s s24">Result: a capital investment in a startup this
quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter&mdash;stimulating
another round of investments in startups.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s26">As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system
were simply the latest round of investments in it.</span>
<span class="s s27">What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional.</span>  
<span class="s s28">At least, I think it was.</span>  <span class="s s29">The venture capital business is pretty incestuous,
and there were presumably people in a position, if not to create
this situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s31">
    A year later the game was up.  Starting in January 2000, Yahoo's
stock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of its
value.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s32">Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market
cap, Yahoo was still worth a lot.</span>  <span class="s s33">Even at the morning-after
valuations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managed
to create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s35">The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard
during the Bubble about the "new economy," there was a
core of truth.</span>  <span class="s s36">You need
that to get a really big bubble: you need to have something
solid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in.</span>
<span class="s s37">(Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost money
in the South Sea Bubble of 1720.</span><span class="s s38">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s39">Now the pendulum has swung the other way.</span>  <span class="s s40">Now anything that
became fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable.</span>
<span class="s s41">But that's a mistake&mdash;an even bigger mistake than believing
what everyone was saying in 1999.</span>  <span class="s s42">Over the long term,
what the Bubble got right will be more important than what
it got wrong.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s44">
    1. Retail VC
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s45">After the excesses of the Bubble, it's now
considered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings.</span>
<span class="s s46">But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with
that idea.</span>  <span class="s s47">Taking a company public at an early stage is simply
retail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round of
funding, you go to the public markets.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s49">By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no
earnings were being derided as "concept stocks," as if it
were inherently stupid to invest in them.</span>
<span class="s s50">But investing in concepts isn't stupid; it's what VCs do,
and the best of them are far from stupid.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s52">
    The stock of a company that doesn't yet have earnings is  
worth
    <i>
     something.
    </i>
    It may take a while for the market to learn
how to value such companies, just as it had to learn to
value common stocks in the early 20th century.</span>   <span class="s s53">But markets
are good at solving that kind of problem.</span>  <span class="s s54">I wouldn't be
surprised if the market ultimately did a better
job than VCs do now.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s56">Going public early will not be the right plan
for every company.</span>
<span class="s s57">And it can of course be
disruptive&mdash;by distracting the management, or by making the early
employees suddenly rich.</span>  <span class="s s58">But just as the market will learn
how to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize
the damage of going public.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s60">
    2. The Internet
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s61">The Internet genuinely is a big deal.</span>  <span class="s s62">That was one reason
even smart people were fooled by the Bubble.</span>  <span class="s s63">Obviously 
it was going to have a huge effect.</span>  <span class="s s64">Enough of an effect to
triple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years?</span>  <span class="s s65">No, as it
turned out.</span>  <span class="s s66">But it was hard to say for certain at the time.</span> <span class="s s67">[1]</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s68">The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles.</span>
<span class="s s69">What drove them was the invention of organized public finance
(the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitor
of the Bank of England).</span>  <span class="s s70">And that did turn out to be
a big deal, in the long run.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s72">Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than 
figuring out how to profit from it.</span>  <span class="s s73">The mistake
investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally.</span>
<span class="s s74">Since the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposed
that the more Internettish the company, the better.</span>  <span class="s s75">Hence
such parodies as Pets.</span><span class="s s76">Com.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s78">In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made
indirectly.</span>  <span class="s s79">It was not the railroads themselves that 
made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies
on either side, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails,
and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast,
where it could be shipped to Europe.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s81">I think the Internet will have great effects,
and that what we've seen so far is nothing compared to what's
coming.</span>  <span class="s s82">But most of the winners will only indirectly be
Internet companies; for every Google there will be ten
JetBlues.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s84">
    3. Choices
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s85">Why will the Internet have great effects?</span>  <span class="s s86">The general   
argument is that new forms of communication always do.</span>  <span class="s s87">They happen
rarely (till industrial times there were just speech, writing, and printing),
but when they do, they always cause a big splash.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s89">The specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us  
more choices.</span>  <span class="s s90">In the "old" economy,
the high cost of presenting information to people meant they
had only a narrow range of options to choose from.</span>  <span class="s s91">The tiny,
expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named "the channel.</span><span class="s s92">"</span>
<span class="s s93">Control the channel and you
could feed them what you wanted, on your terms.  And it
was not just big corporations that depended
on this principle.</span>  <span class="s s94">So, in their way, did
labor unions, the traditional news media,
and the art and literary establishments.</span>
<span class="s s95">Winning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining control
of some bottleneck.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s97">There are signs that this is changing.</span>
<span class="s s98">Google has over 82 million unique users a month and
annual revenues of about three billion dollars.</span> <span class="s s99">[2]
And yet have you ever seen
a Google ad?</span>
<span class="s s100">Something is going on here.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s102">Admittedly, Google is an extreme case.</span>  <span class="s s103">It's very easy for
people to switch to a new search engine.</span>  <span class="s s104">It costs little
effort and no money to try a new one, and it's easy to
see if the results are better.</span><span class="s s105">  And so Google doesn't
    <i>
     have
    </i>
    to advertise.</span>  <span class="s s106">In a business like theirs, being the best is
enough.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s108">The exciting thing about the Internet is that it's
shifting everything in that direction.</span>
<span class="s s109">The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff,
is the beginning.</span>  <span class="s s110">Eventually everyone
will learn by word of mouth that you're the best,
but how do you survive to that point?</span>  <span class="s s111">And it is in this crucial
stage that the Internet has the most effect.</span>  <span class="s s112">First, the
Internet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost.</span>
<span class="s s113">Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which
reputation spreads by word of mouth.</span>  <span class="s s114">Together these mean that in many
fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.</span>
<span class="s s115">Make something great and put it online.</span>
<span class="s s116">That is a big change from the recipe for winning in the
past century.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s118">
    4. Youth
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s119">The aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed most
taken with was the youth of some of the startup founders.</span>
<span class="s s120">This too is a trend that will last.</span>
<span class="s s121">There is a huge standard deviation among 26 year olds.</span>  <span class="s s122">Some
are fit only for entry level jobs, but others are
ready to rule the world if they can find someone to handle
the paperwork for them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s124">A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or
dealing with the SEC.</span>  <span class="s s125">Those require experience.</span>
<span class="s s126">But those are also commodities, which can be handed off to
some lieutenant.</span>  <span class="s s127">The most important quality in a CEO is his
vision for the company's future.</span>  <span class="s s128">What will they build next?</span>
<span class="s s129">And in that department, there are 26 year olds who can
compete with anyone.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s131">In 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, at
least.</span>   <span class="s s132">If he had technologists working for him, they were 
treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful.</span>  <span class="s s133">But 
as technology has grown more important, the power of nerds
has grown to reflect it.</span>  <span class="s s134">Now it's not enough for a CEO to
have someone smart he can ask about technical matters.</span>   <span class="s s135">Increasingly,
he has to be that person himself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s137">As always, business has clung to old forms.  VCs still seem
to want to install a legitimate-looking 
talking head as the CEO.</span>  <span class="s s138">But increasingly the founders of
the company are the real powers, and the grey-headed man
installed by the VCs more like a
music group's manager than a general.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s140">
    5. Informality
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s141">In New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences:
suits went out of fashion.</span>  <span class="s s142">They made one seem old.</span>  <span class="s s143">So in
1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearing
open-necked shirts and khakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses,
just like guys in Santa Clara.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s145">The pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panicked
reaction by the clothing industry.</span>  <span class="s s146">But I'm betting on the
open-necked shirts.</span>  <span class="s s147">And this is not as frivolous a question
as it might seem.</span>  <span class="s s148">Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense,
though they may not realize it consciously.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s150">If you're a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are
by asking yourself how you'd feel about a company
that made you wear a suit and tie to work.</span>  <span class="s s151">The idea sounds
horrible, doesn't it?</span>  <span class="s s152">In fact, horrible far out of proportion
to the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes.</span>  <span class="s s153">A company that
made programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrong
with it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s155">And what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneself
counted more than the quality of one's ideas.</span><span class="s s156">
    <i>
     That's
    </i>
    the problem with formality.</span>  <span class="s s157">Dressing up is not so much bad in
itself.</span>  <span class="s s158">The problem is the receptor it binds to: dressing
up is inevitably a substitute
for good ideas.</span>   <span class="s s159">It is no coincidence that technically
inept business types are known as "suits.</span><span class="s s160">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s162">Nerds don't just happen to dress informally.</span>  <span class="s s163">They do it too
consistently.</span>  <span class="s s164">Consciously or not, they dress informally as
a prophylactic measure against stupidity.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s166">
    6. Nerds
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s167">Clothing is only the most visible battleground in the war
against formality.</span>  <span class="s s168">Nerds tend to eschew formality of any sort.</span>
<span class="s s169">They're not impressed by one's job title, for example,
or any of the other appurtenances of authority.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s171">Indeed, that's practically the definition of a nerd.</span>  <span class="s s172">I found
myself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planning
a show about nerds.</span>  <span class="s s173">I thought it would be useful if I
explained what a nerd was.</span>  <span class="s s174">What I came up with was: someone who
doesn't expend any effort on marketing himself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s176">A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance.</span>
<span class="s s177">So what's the connection between nerds and technology?</span> <span class="s s178">Roughly
that you can't fool mother nature.</span> <span class="s s179">In technical matters, you
have to get the right answers.</span>  <span class="s s180">If your software miscalculates
the path of a space probe, you can't finesse your way out of
trouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde,
or any of the other dodges people use in nontechnical
fields.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s182">
    And as technology becomes increasingly important in the
economy, nerd culture is
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/nerdad.html">
     rising
    </a>
    with it.</span>  <span class="s s183">Nerds are already
a lot cooler than they were when I was a kid.</span>  <span class="s s184">When I was in
college in the mid-1980s, "nerd" was still an insult.</span>  <span class="s s185">People
who majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it.</span>
<span class="s s186">Now women ask me where they can meet nerds.</span>  <span class="s s187">(The answer that
springs to mind is "Usenix," but that would be like drinking
from a firehose.</span><span class="s s188">)</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s189">I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming
more accepted.</span>  <span class="s s190">It's not because people are
realizing that substance is more important than marketing.</span>
<span class="s s191">It's because the nerds are getting 
rich.</span>  <span class="s s192">But that is not going
to change.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s194">
    7. Options
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s195">What makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options.</span>  <span class="s s196">Now there
are moves afoot to make it harder for companies to grant   
options.</span>  <span class="s s197">To the extent there's some genuine accounting abuse 
going on, by all means correct it.</span>  <span class="s s198">But don't kill the golden  
goose.</span>  <span class="s s199">Equity is the fuel that drives technical innovation.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s201">Options are a good idea because (a) they're fair, and (b) they
work.</span>  <span class="s s202">Someone who goes to work for a company is (one hopes)   
adding to its value, and it's only fair to give them a share
of it.</span><span class="s s203">  And as a purely practical measure, people work a
    <i>
     lot
    </i>
    harder when they have options.</span>  <span class="s s204">I've seen that first hand.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s206">The fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their
companies by granting themselves options doesn't mean options
are a bad idea.</span>  <span class="s s207">During the railroad boom, some executives
enriched themselves by selling watered stock&mdash;by issuing more
shares than they said were outstanding.</span>  <span class="s s208">But that doesn't  
make common stock a bad idea.</span>  <span class="s s209">Crooks just use whatever
means are available.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s211">If there is a problem with options, it's that they reward
slightly the wrong thing.</span>  <span class="s s212">Not surprisingly, people do what you
pay them to.</span> <span class="s s213">If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of
hours.</span>  <span class="s s214">If you pay them by the volume of work done, they'll
get a lot of work done (but only as you defined work).</span>
<span class="s s215">And if you pay them to raise the
stock price, which is what options amount to, they'll raise
the stock price.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s217">But that's not quite what you want.</span>  <span class="s s218">What you want is to
increase the actual value of the company, not its market cap.</span>
<span class="s s219">Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly
as options vest.</span><span class="s s220">  Which means options tempt employees, if
only unconsciously, to "pump and dump"&mdash;to do things
that will make the company
    <i>
     seem
    </i>
    valuable.</span>
<span class="s s221">I found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn't help thinking,   
"how will this sound to investors?</span><span class="s s222">"</span>  <span class="s s223">when I should have been
thinking "is this a good idea?</span><span class="s s224">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s226">So maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly.</span>
<span class="s s227">Maybe options should be replaced with something tied more
directly to earnings.</span>  <span class="s s228">It's still early days.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s230">
    8. Startups
   </span></h3>
   <p><span class="s s231">
    What made the options valuable, for the most part, is
that they were options on the stock of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">
     startups
    </a>
    .</span>  <span class="s s232">Startups   
were not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they
were more visible during the Bubble than ever before.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s234">One thing most people did learn about for the first time
during the Bubble was the startup
created with the intention of selling it.</span>
<span class="s s235">Originally a
startup meant a small company that hoped to grow into a
big one.</span>  <span class="s s236">But increasingly startups are evolving into a
vehicle for developing technology on spec.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s238">
    As I wrote in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">
     Hackers &amp; Painters
    </a>
    , employees seem to be most
productive when they're paid in proportion to the wealth
they generate.</span><span class="s s239">  And the advantage of a startup&mdash;indeed,   
almost its raison d'etre&mdash;is that it offers something
otherwise impossible to obtain: a way of
    <i>
     measuring
    </i>
    that.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s241">In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies
to get technology by buying startups rather than developing   
it in house.</span>  <span class="s s242">You pay more, but there is less risk,
and risk is what big companies don't want.</span>  <span class="s s243">It makes the
guys developing the technology more accountable, because they
only get paid if they build the winner.</span>  <span class="s s244">And you end up   
with better technology, created faster, because things are
made in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of 
the bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s246">Our startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold.</span>  <span class="s s247">We were open
with investors about that from the start.</span>  <span class="s s248">And we were     
careful to create something that could slot easily into a
larger company.</span>  <span class="s s249">That is the pattern for the future.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s251">
    9. California
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s252">The Bubble was a California phenomenon.</span>  <span class="s s253">When I showed up
in Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like an immigrant from
Eastern Europe arriving in America in 1900.</span>  <span class="s s254">Everyone
was so cheerful and healthy and rich.</span>  <span class="s s255">It seemed a new
and improved world.</span>

    <span class="s s257">The press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives  
one the impression that Silicon Valley is a ghost town.</span>
<span class="s s258">Not at all.</span>  <span class="s s259">When I drive down 101 from the airport,
I still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a giant
transformer nearby.</span>  <span class="s s260">Real estate is still more expensive
than just about anywhere else in the country.</span>  <span class="s s261">The people     
still look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous.</span>
<span class="s s262">The future is there.</span>
<span class="s s263">(I say "there" because I moved back to the East Coast after
Yahoo.</span>  <span class="s s264">I still wonder if this was a smart idea.</span><span class="s s265">)</span>

    <span class="s s266">What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the
people.</span>  <span class="s s267">I notice that when I come home to Boston.</span>
<span class="s s268">The first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminal
is the fat, grumpy guy in
charge of the taxi line.</span><span class="s s269">  I brace myself for rudeness:

    <span class="s s270">The atmosphere varies from city to city, and fragile
organisms like startups are exceedingly sensitive to such variation.</span>
<span class="s s271">If it hadn't already been hijacked as a new euphemism
for liberal, the word to describe the atmosphere in
the Bay Area would be "progressive.</span><span class="s s272">"</span>  <span class="s s273">People there are trying
to build the future.</span><span class="s s274">
Boston has MIT and Harvard, but it also has a lot of
truculent, unionized employees like the police who

    , and a lot of people trying to be

    <span class="s s277">Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but it
is at least the next Chicago.</span>  <span class="s s278">For the next fifty years,   
that's where new wealth will come from.</span>

   <h3><span class="s s280">
    10. Productivity
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s281">During the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify high
price to earnings ratios by saying that technology was going 
to increase productivity dramatically.</span>  <span class="s s282">They were wrong about
the specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlying
principle.</span>  <span class="s s283">I think one of the big trends we'll see in the
coming century is a huge increase in productivity.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s285">
    Or more precisely, a huge increase in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html">
     variation
    </a>
    in
productivity.</span>  <span class="s s286">Technology is a lever.</span>  <span class="s s287">It doesn't add;     
it multiplies.</span>  <span class="s s288">If the present range of productivity is  
0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the range
from 0 to 1000.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s290">One upshot of which is that the companies of the future may
be surprisingly small.</span>  <span class="s s291">I sometimes daydream about how big
you could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having
more than ten people.</span>  <span class="s s292">What would happen if you outsourced
everything except product development?</span>  <span class="s s293">If you tried this experiment,
I think you'd be surprised at how far you could get.</span> 
<span class="s s294">As Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups are
intrinsically more productive, because the
internal friction in a group grows as the
square of its size.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s296">Till quite recently, running a major company
meant managing an army of workers.</span>  <span class="s s297">Our standards about how
many employees a company should have are still influenced by
old patterns.</span>  <span class="s s298">Startups are perforce small, because they can't
afford to hire a lot of people.</span>  <span class="s s299">But I think it's a big mistake for
companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase.</span>  <span class="s s300">The
question is not whether you can afford the extra salaries.</span>   
<span class="s s301">Can you afford the loss in productivity that comes from making
the company bigger?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s303">The prospect of technological leverage will of course raise the
specter of unemployment.</span>  <span class="s s304">I'm surprised people still worry about
this.</span>
<span class="s s305">After centuries of supposedly job-killing innovations,
the number of jobs is within ten percent of the number of people
who want them.</span>  <span class="s s306">This can't be a coincidence.</span>  <span class="s s307">There must be some
kind of balancing mechanism.</span>
   </p>
   <h3><span class="s s309">
    What's New
   </span></h3>
   <p>
    <span class="s s310">When one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme?</span>
<span class="s s311">There does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideas
will count for more.</span>  <span class="s s312">That 26
year olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50
year olds with powerful connections.</span>  <span class="s s313">That doing good work will
matter more than dressing up&mdash;or advertising, which is the
same thing for companies.</span>  <span class="s s314">That people
will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what
they create.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s316">If so, this is good news indeed.</span>
<span class="s s317">Good ideas always tend to win eventually.</span>  <span class="s s318">The problem is,
it can take a very long time.</span>
<span class="s s319">It took decades for relativity to be accepted, and the
greater part of a century to establish that central planning didn't work.</span>
<span class="s s320">So even a small increase in the
rate at which good ideas win would be a momentous
change&mdash;big enough, probably, to justify a name like
the "new economy.</span><span class="s s321">"</span>

    <span class="s s324">[1] Actually it's hard to say now.</span>  <span class="s s325">As Jeremy Siegel points
out, if the value of a stock is its future earnings, you 
can't tell if it was overvalued till you see what the earnings
turn out to be.</span>   <span class="s s326">While certain famous Internet stocks were
almost certainly overvalued in 1999, it is still hard to say for sure
whether, e.</span><span class="s s327">g.</span><span class="s s328">, the Nasdaq index was.</span>
