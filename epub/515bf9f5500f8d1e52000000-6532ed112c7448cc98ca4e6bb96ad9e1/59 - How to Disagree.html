   How to Disagree
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">
   March 2008
  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">The web is turning writing into a conversation.</span>  <span class="s s4">Twenty years ago,
writers wrote and readers read.</span>  <span class="s s5">The web lets readers respond, and
increasingly they do&mdash;in comment threads, on forums, and in their
own blog posts.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">Many who respond to something disagree with it.</span>  <span class="s s8">That's to be
expected.</span>  <span class="s s9">Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.</span>
<span class="s s10">And when you agree there's less to say.</span>  <span class="s s11">You could expand on something
the author said, but he has probably already explored the
most interesting implications.</span>  <span class="s s12">When you disagree you're entering
territory he may not have explored.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially
measured by the word.</span>  <span class="s s15">That doesn't mean people are getting angrier.</span>
<span class="s s16">The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account
for it.</span>  <span class="s s17">But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in
disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement
will make people angrier.</span>  <span class="s s18">Particularly online, where it's easy to
say things you'd never say face to face.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s20">If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to
do it well.</span>  <span class="s s21">What does it mean to disagree well?</span>   <span class="s s22">Most readers can
tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully
reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the
intermediate stages.</span>  <span class="s s23">So here's an attempt at a disagreement
hierarchy:</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s24">
   DH0. Name-calling.
  </span></h3>
  <p><span class="s s25">
   This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most
common.  We've all seen comments like this:
   </span></p><blockquote><span class="s s26">
    u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s27">
   But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has
just as little weight.  A comment like
   </span><blockquote><span class="s s28">
    The author is a self-important dilettante.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s29">
   is really nothing more than a pretentious version of "u r a fag."
  
  </span><h3><span class="s s30">
   DH1. Ad Hominem.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s31">An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.</span>  <span class="s s32">It
might actually carry some weight.</span>  <span class="s s33">For example, if a senator wrote
an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could
respond:</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s34">
    Of course he would say that.  He's a senator.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s35">
   This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be
relevant to the case.  It's still a very weak form of disagreement,
though.  If there's something wrong with the senator's argument,
you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does
it make that he's a senator?
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s36">Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic
is a variant of ad hominem&mdash;and a particularly useless sort, because
good ideas often come from outsiders.</span>  <span class="s s37">The question is whether the
author is correct or not.</span>  <span class="s s38">If his lack of authority caused him to
make mistakes, point those out.</span>  <span class="s s39">And if it didn't, it's not a
problem.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s41">
   DH2. Responding to Tone.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s42">The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather
than the writer.</span>  <span class="s s43">The lowest form of these is to disagree with the
author's tone.</span>  <span class="s s44">E.</span><span class="s s45">g.</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s47">
    I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s48">
   Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form
of disagreement.  It matters much more whether the author is wrong
or right than what his tone is.  Especially since tone is so hard
to judge.  Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic
might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.
  
  </span><p>
   <span class="s s49">So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize
its tone, you're not saying much.</span>  <span class="s s50">Is the author flippant, but
correct?</span>  <span class="s s51">Better that than grave and wrong.</span>  <span class="s s52">And if the author is
incorrect somewhere, say where.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s54">
   DH3. Contradiction.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s55">In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather
than how or by whom.</span>  <span class="s s56">The lowest form of response to an argument
is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting
evidence.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s58">
   This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:
   </span></p><blockquote>
    <span class="s s59">I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.</span>  <span class="s s60">Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific
  theory.</span>
   </blockquote><span class="s s62">
   Contradiction can sometimes have some weight.  Sometimes merely
seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that
it's right.  But usually evidence will help.
  
  </span><h3><span class="s s63">
   DH4. Counterargument.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s64">At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:
counterargument.</span>  <span class="s s65">Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as
proving nothing.</span>  <span class="s s66">Counterargument might prove something.</span>  <span class="s s67">The problem
is, it's hard to say exactly what.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s69">Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.</span>
<span class="s s70">When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.</span>
<span class="s s71">But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at
something slightly different.</span>  <span class="s s72">More often than not, two people
arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two
different things.</span>  <span class="s s73">Sometimes they even agree with one another, but
are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s75">There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something
slightly different from what the original author said: when you
feel they missed the heart of the matter.</span>  <span class="s s76">But when you do that,
you should say explicitly you're doing it.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s78">
   DH5. Refutation.
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s79">The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.</span>  <span class="s s80">It's also
the rarest, because it's the most work.</span>  <span class="s s81">Indeed, the disagreement
hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you
go the fewer instances you find.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s83">To refute someone you probably have to quote them.</span>  <span class="s s84">You have to
find a "smoking gun," a passage in whatever you disagree with that
you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken.</span>  <span class="s s85">If you
can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing
with a straw man.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily
imply refutation.</span>  <span class="s s88">Some writers quote parts of things they disagree
with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow
with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.</span>
  </p>
  <h3><span class="s s90">
   DH6. Refuting the Central Point.
  </span></h3>
  <p><span class="s s91">
   The force of a refutation depends on what you refute.  The most
powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s92">Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,
as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes
those.</span>  <span class="s s93">Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more
of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.</span>  <span class="s s94">For
example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes
in names or numbers.</span>  <span class="s s95">Unless the opposing argument actually depends
on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to
discredit one's opponent.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s97">Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,
or at least one of them.</span>  <span class="s s98">And that means one has to commit explicitly
to what the central point is.</span>  <span class="s s99">So a truly effective refutation would
look like:</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s100">
    The author's main point seems to be x.  As he says:
    </span><blockquote><span class="s s101">
     &lt;quotation&gt;
    </span></blockquote><span class="s s102">
    But this is wrong for the following reasons...
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s103">
   The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual
statement of the author's main point.  It's enough to refute something
it depends upon.
  
  </span><h3><span class="s s104">
   What It Means
  </span></h3>
  <p>
   <span class="s s105">Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement.</span>  <span class="s s106">What good
is it?</span><span class="s s107">  One thing the disagreement hierarchy
   <i>
    doesn't
   </i>
   give us is
a way of picking a winner.</span>  <span class="s s108">DH levels merely describe the form of
a statement, not whether it's correct.</span>  <span class="s s109">A DH6 response could still
be completely mistaken.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness
of a reply, they do set an upper bound.</span>  <span class="s s112">A DH6 response might be
unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s114">The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement
is that it will help people to evaluate what they read.</span>  <span class="s s115">In particular,
it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.</span>
<span class="s s116">An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing
an opponent merely by using forceful words.</span>  <span class="s s117">In fact that is probably
the defining quality of a demagogue.</span>  <span class="s s118">By giving names to the different
forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping
such balloons.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s120">Such labels may help writers too.</span>  <span class="s s121">Most intellectual dishonesty is
unintentional.</span>  <span class="s s122">Someone arguing against the tone of something he
disagrees with may believe he's really saying something.</span>  <span class="s s123">Zooming
out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy
may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s125">But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it
will make conversations better, but that it will make the people
who have them happier.</span>  <span class="s s126">If you study conversations, you find there
is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.</span>  <span class="s s127">You don't have
to be mean when you have a real point to make.</span>  <span class="s s128">In fact, you don't
want to.</span>  <span class="s s129">If you have something real to say, being mean just gets
in the way.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s131">If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,
that will make most of them happier.</span>  <span class="s s132">Most people don't really enjoy
being mean; they do it because they can't help it.</span>
