    Why Nerds are Unpopular
   </span></h1>
   </h2><p><span class="s s2">
    February 2003
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s3">When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map
of the school lunch tables according to popularity.</span> <span class="s s4">This was easy
to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same
popularity.</span> <span class="s s5">We graded them from A to E.</span> <span class="s s6">A tables were full of
football players and cheerleaders and so on.</span> <span class="s s7">E tables contained the
kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of
the time we called "retards.</span><span class="s s8">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s10">We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking
physically different.</span> <span class="s s11">We were not being especially candid to grade
ourselves as D.</span> <span class="s s12">It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.</span>
<span class="s s13">Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,
including us.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s15">My stock gradually rose during high school.</span> <span class="s s16">Puberty finally arrived;
I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground
newspaper.</span>  <span class="s s17">So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s19">I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell
the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart
and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between
being a nerd and being popular.</span><span class="s s20"> Being smart seems to
    <i>
     make
    </i>
    you
unpopular.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s22">Why?</span> <span class="s s23">To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to
ask.</span> <span class="s s24">The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to
imagine that it could be any other way.</span> <span class="s s25">But it could.</span> <span class="s s26">Being smart
doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school.</span> <span class="s s27">Nor does it harm
you in the real world.</span> <span class="s s28">Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem
so bad in most other countries.</span> <span class="s s29">But in a typical American secondary
school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.</span> <span class="s s30">Why?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s32">The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly.</span> <span class="s s33">Why
don't smart kids make themselves popular?</span> <span class="s s34">If they're so smart, why
don't they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,
just as they do for standardized tests?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s36">One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart
kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,
and nothing they could do could make them popular.</span> <span class="s s37">I wish.</span> <span class="s s38">If the
other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job
of concealing it.</span> <span class="s s39">And in any case, if being smart were really an
enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks.</span> <span class="s s40">The guys that
guys envy, girls like.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s42">In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much.</span> <span class="s s43">Kids
didn't admire it or despise it.</span> <span class="s s44">All other things being equal, they
would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the
dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical
appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s46">So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are
smart kids so consistently unpopular?</span> <span class="s s47">The answer, I think, is that
they don't really want to be popular.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s49">If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at
him.</span> <span class="s s50">Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them
so miserable that they commit suicide.</span> <span class="s s51">Telling me that I didn't
want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of
thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water.</span> <span class="s s52">Of course
I wanted to be popular.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">But in fact I didn't, not enough.</span> <span class="s s55">There was something else I wanted
more: to be smart.</span> <span class="s s56">Not simply to do well in school, though that
counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write
well, or to understand how to program computers.</span> <span class="s s57">In general, to
make great things.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s59">At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them
against one another.</span> <span class="s s60">If I had, I would have seen that being smart
was more important.</span> <span class="s s61">If someone had offered me the chance to be
the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of
average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s63">Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many
nerds would.</span> <span class="s s64">To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable.</span>
<span class="s s65">But most kids would take that deal.</span> <span class="s s66">For half of them, it would be
a step up.</span> <span class="s s67">Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming,
as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who
wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired
by everyone?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s69">And that, I think, is the root of the problem.</span> <span class="s s70">Nerds serve two
masters.</span> <span class="s s71">They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even
more to be smart.</span> <span class="s s72">And popularity is not something you can do in
your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an
American secondary school.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s74">Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that
"no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you
want to excel in it.</span><span class="s s75">"</span>
<span class="s s76">I wonder if anyone in the world works harder
at anything than American school kids work at popularity.</span> <span class="s s77">Navy SEALs
and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison.</span> <span class="s s78">They
occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies.</span> <span class="s s79">An American
teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a
year.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s81">I don't mean to suggest they do this consciously.</span> <span class="s s82">Some of them truly
are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers
are always on duty as conformists.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s84">For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes.</span>
<span class="s s85">They don't consciously dress to be popular.</span> <span class="s s86">They dress to look good.</span>
<span class="s s87">But to who?</span> <span class="s s88">To the other kids.</span> <span class="s s89">Other kids' opinions become their
definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything
they do, right down to the way they walk.</span> <span class="s s90">And so every effort they
make to do things "right" is also, consciously or not, an effort
to be more popular.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s92">Nerds don't realize this.</span> <span class="s s93">They don't realize that it takes work to
be popular.</span> <span class="s s94">In general, people outside some very demanding field
don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though
often unconscious) effort.</span> <span class="s s95">For example, most people seem to consider
the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.</span>
<span class="s s96">In fact, most people who "can draw" like drawing, and have spent
many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it.</span> <span class="s s97">Likewise, popular
isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make
yourself.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s99">The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things
to think about.</span> <span class="s s100">Their attention is drawn to books or the natural
world, not fashions and parties.</span> <span class="s s101">They're like someone trying to
play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head.</span> <span class="s s102">Other
players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them
effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s104">Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being
popular would be more work for them.</span> <span class="s s105">The popular kids learned to
be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned
to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents.</span> <span class="s s106">While the
nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids
were being trained to please.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s108">So far I've been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd,
using them as if they were interchangeable.</span> <span class="s s109">In fact it's only the
context that makes them so.</span> <span class="s s110">A nerd is someone who isn't socially
adept enough.</span> <span class="s s111">But "enough" depends on where you are.</span> <span class="s s112">In a typical
American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least,
so specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look
awkward by comparison.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s114">Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires.</span>
<span class="s s115">Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or
siblings of popular kids, they'll tend to become nerds.</span> <span class="s s116">And that's
why smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven
and seventeen.</span> <span class="s s117">Life at that age revolves far more around popularity
than before or after.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s119">Before that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by
other kids.</span> <span class="s s120">Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school,
but this isn't their whole life, as it later becomes.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s122">Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their
family as a day job.</span> <span class="s s123">They create a new world among themselves, and
standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family.</span>
<span class="s s124">Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the
world they care about.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s126">The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at
first a very crude one.</span><span class="s s127"> If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds
to their own devices, what you get is
    <i>
     Lord of the Flies.
    </i>
    Like
a lot of American kids, I read this book in school.</span> <span class="s s128">Presumably it
was not a coincidence.</span> <span class="s s129">Presumably someone wanted to point out to
us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and
stupid world.</span> <span class="s s130">This was too subtle for me.</span> <span class="s s131">While the book seemed
entirely believable, I didn't get the additional message.</span> <span class="s s132">I wish
they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world
was stupid.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s134">Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely
caused them to be ignored.</span> <span class="s s135">Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school
is to be actively persecuted.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s137">Why?</span> <span class="s s138">Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a
strange question to ask.</span> <span class="s s139">How could things be any other way?</span> <span class="s s140">But
they could be.</span> <span class="s s141">Adults don't normally persecute nerds.</span> <span class="s s142">Why do teenage
kids do it?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s144">Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many
children are just intrinsically cruel.</span> <span class="s s145">Some torture nerds for the
same reason they pull the legs off spiders.</span> <span class="s s146">Before you develop a
conscience, torture is amusing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s148">Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel
better.</span> <span class="s s149">When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water
down.</span> <span class="s s150">Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own
position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think
rank below.</span> <span class="s s151">I've read that this is why poor whites in the United
States are the group most hostile to blacks.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s153">But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's
part of the mechanism of popularity.</span> <span class="s s154">Popularity is only partially
about individual attractiveness.</span> <span class="s s155">It's much more about alliances.</span>
<span class="s s156">To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that
bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people
closer than a common enemy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s158">Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at
home, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one.</span> <span class="s s159">By singling
out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the
hierarchy create bonds between themselves.</span> <span class="s s160">Attacking an outsider
makes them all insiders.</span> <span class="s s161">This is why the worst cases of bullying
happen with groups.</span> <span class="s s162">Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from
a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s164">If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal.</span> <span class="s s165">The
group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same
thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together
to go hunting.</span> <span class="s s166">They don't actually hate you.</span> <span class="s s167">They just need something
to chase.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s169">Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target
for the entire school.</span> <span class="s s170">If I remember correctly, the most popular
kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things.</span>
<span class="s s171">Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous
middle classes.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s173">The trouble is, there are a lot of them.</span> <span class="s s174">The distribution of
popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.</span>
<span class="s s175">The least popular group is quite small.</span> <span class="s s176">(I believe we were the only
D table in our cafeteria map.</span><span class="s s177">) So there are more people who want
to pick on nerds than there are nerds.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s179">As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,
one loses points by being close to them.</span> <span class="s s180">A woman I know says that
in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking
to them because the other girls would make fun of her.</span> <span class="s s181">Unpopularity
is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still
ostracize them in self-defense.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s183">It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle
school and high school.</span> <span class="s s184">Their other interests leave them little
attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles
a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole
school.</span> <span class="s s185">And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens
without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the
situation.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s187">For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new
and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate
the smarter kids had barely begun.</span> <span class="s s188">Nearly everyone I've talked to
agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s190">In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen
for me.</span> <span class="s s191">There was a brief sensation that year when one of our
teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and
was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an
eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s193">It didn't have any noticeable effect.</span> <span class="s s194">What struck me at the time
was that she was surprised.</span> <span class="s s195">You mean she doesn't know the kind of
things they say to one another?</span> <span class="s s196">You mean this isn't normal?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s198">It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the
kids are doing to one another.</span> <span class="s s199">They know, in the abstract, that
kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the
abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries.</span> <span class="s s200">But, like
us, they don't like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don't
see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s202">Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison
wardens.</span> <span class="s s203">Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the
premises.</span> <span class="s s204">They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible
prevent them from killing one another.</span> <span class="s s205">Beyond that, they want to
have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave
them to create whatever social organization they want.</span> <span class="s s206">From what
I've read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage,
and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s208">In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to.</span> <span class="s s209">The most
important thing was to stay on the premises.</span> <span class="s s210">While there, the
authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort
to teach you something.</span> <span class="s s211">But beyond that they didn't want to have
too much to do with the kids.</span> <span class="s s212">Like prison wardens, the teachers
mostly left us to ourselves.</span> <span class="s s213">And, like prisoners, the culture we
created was barbaric.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s215">Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds?</span> <span class="s s216">It might seem that
the answer is simply that it's populated by adults, who are too
mature to pick on one another.</span> <span class="s s217">But I don't think this is true.</span>
<span class="s s218">Adults in prison certainly pick on one another.</span> <span class="s s219">And so, apparently,
do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds
like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s221">I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's
populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you
do have real effects.</span> <span class="s s222">That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch
all lack.</span> <span class="s s223">The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little
bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.</span>
<span class="s s224">Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery.</span> <span class="s s225">They have no
function for their form to follow.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s227">When the things you do have real effects, it's no longer enough
just to be pleasing.</span> <span class="s s228">It starts to be important to get the right
answers, and that's where nerds show to advantage.</span> <span class="s s229">Bill Gates will
of course come to mind.</span> <span class="s s230">Though notoriously lacking in social skills,
he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s232">The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's
much larger.</span> <span class="s s233">In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities
can achieve a critical mass if they clump together.</span> <span class="s s234">Out in the real
world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies
where intelligence is the most important thing.</span> <span class="s s235">Sometimes the current
even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly
in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately
exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter.</span> <span class="s s236">John Nash
so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the
wall as he walked down a corridor.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s238">As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of
the world than what I saw immediately around me.</span><span class="s s239"> The warped little
world we lived in was, I thought,
    <i>
     the world.
    </i>
    The world seemed cruel
and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s241">Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must
be wrong with me.</span> <span class="s s242">I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't
fit in was that in some ways
we were a step ahead.</span> <span class="s s243">We were already thinking about
the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending
all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the
others.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s245">We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into
middle school.</span> <span class="s s246">He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right
music to like, the right slang to use.</span> <span class="s s247">He'd seem to the kids a
complete alien.</span> <span class="s s248">The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what
they thought.</span> <span class="s s249">We had no such confidence.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s251">A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown
together with "normal" kids at this stage of their lives.</span> <span class="s s252">Perhaps.</span>
<span class="s s253">But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really
is that everyone else is crazy.</span> <span class="s s254">I remember sitting in the audience
at a "pep rally" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders
threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn
to pieces.</span> <span class="s s255">I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal
ritual.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s257">If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice,
the main thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look
around.</span> <span class="s s258">I didn't really grasp it at the time, but the whole world
we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie.</span> <span class="s s259">Not just school, but the
entire town.</span> <span class="s s260">Why do people move to suburbia?</span> <span class="s s261">To have kids!</span> <span class="s s262">So no
wonder it seemed boring and sterile.</span> <span class="s s263">The whole place was a giant
nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of
breeding children.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s265">Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing
to do.</span> <span class="s s266">This was no accident.</span> <span class="s s267">Suburbs are deliberately designed to
exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could
endanger children.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s269">And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this
fake world.</span> <span class="s s270">Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids.</span> <span class="s s271">In
fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one
place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done.</span> <span class="s s272">And
I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society,
it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s274">What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that
(a) they aren't told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly
by the inmates.</span> <span class="s s275">Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing
meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run
after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing
in the world.</span> <span class="s s276">And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they're
called misfits.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s278">
    Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just
for the nerds. Like any war, it's damaging even to the winners.
   </span></p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s279">Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented.</span> <span class="s s280">So why
don't they do something about it?</span> <span class="s s281">Because they blame it on puberty.</span><span class="s s282">
The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that
monstrous new chemicals,
    <i>
     hormones
    </i>
    , are now coursing through their
bloodstream and messing up everything.</span> <span class="s s283">There's nothing wrong with
the system; it's just inevitable that kids will be miserable at
that age.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s285">This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which
probably doesn't help.</span> <span class="s s286">Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt
is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing
the wrong size shoes.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s288">I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are
intrinsically messed up.</span> <span class="s s289">If it's physiological, it should be
universal.</span> <span class="s s290">Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen?</span> <span class="s s291">I've read
a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference
to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century.</span>
<span class="s s292">Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful
and eager.</span> <span class="s s293">They got in fights and played tricks on one another of
course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they
weren't crazy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s295">As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager
is coeval with suburbia.</span> <span class="s s296">I don't think this is a coincidence.</span> <span class="s s297">I
think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead.</span>
<span class="s s298">Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs.</span> <span class="s s299">Teenagers
now are neurotic lapdogs.</span> <span class="s s300">Their craziness is the craziness of the
idle everywhere.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s302">When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter
kids.</span> <span class="s s303">No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and
some may have tried.</span> <span class="s s304">Mostly this was just a pose.</span> <span class="s s305">Like other
teenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic.</span>
<span class="s s306">But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s308">Bullying was only part of the problem.</span> <span class="s s309">Another problem, and possibly
an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on.</span>
<span class="s s310">Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.</span><span class="s s311">
And all the work we did was
    <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">
     pointless
    </a>
    , or seemed so at the time.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s313">At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future,
so far that we didn't even know at the time what we were practicing
for.</span> <span class="s s314">More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump
through, words without content designed mainly for testability.</span>
<span class="s s315">(The three main causes of the Civil War were.</span><span class="s s316">.</span><span class="s s317">.</span><span class="s s318">.</span>

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s321">And there was no way to opt out.</span> <span class="s s322">The adults had agreed among
themselves that this was to be the route to college.</span> <span class="s s323">The only way
to escape this empty life was to submit to it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s325">Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society.</span> <span class="s s326">In
pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or
another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships.</span> <span class="s s327">They
weren't left to create their own societies.</span> <span class="s s328">They were junior members
of adult societies.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s330">Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because
the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying
to learn.</span> <span class="s s331">Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in
their distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is
precious little) between schoolwork and the work they'll do as
adults.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s333">And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use
for teenagers.</span> <span class="s s334">After a couple years' training, an apprentice could
be a real help.</span> <span class="s s335">Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry
messages or sweep the workshop.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s337">Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers.</span> <span class="s s338">They would be in
the way in an office.</span> <span class="s s339">So they drop them off at school on their way
to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they  
were going away for the weekend.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s341">What happened?</span> <span class="s s342">We're up against a hard one here.</span> <span class="s s343">The cause of this
problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization.</span>
<span class="s s344">As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them.</span>
<span class="s s345">Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at
the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far  
earlier.</span> <span class="s s346">Now kids who go to college don't start working full-time 
till 21 or 22.</span> <span class="s s347">With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not
finish your training till 30.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s349">Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like
fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact.</span> <span class="s s350">In almost
any other kind of work, they'd be a net loss.</span> <span class="s s351">But they're also too 
young to be left unsupervised.</span> <span class="s s352">Someone has to watch over them, and
the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in
one place.</span> <span class="s s353">Then a few adults can watch all of them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s355">If you stop there, what you're describing is literally a prison,
albeit a part-time one.</span> <span class="s s356">The problem is, many schools practically
do stop there.</span> <span class="s s357">The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids.</span>
<span class="s s358">But there is no external pressure to do this well.</span> <span class="s s359">And so most
schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don't really
take it seriously-- not even the smart kids.</span> <span class="s s360">Much of the time we
were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.</span>
   </p>
   <p><span class="s s362">
    In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo's
    <i>
     Les
Miserables.
    </i>
    I don't think any of us knew French well enough to make
our way through this enormous book.</span> <span class="s s363">Like the rest of the class, I   
just skimmed the Cliff's Notes.</span> <span class="s s364">When we were given a test on the
book, I noticed that the questions sounded odd.</span> <span class="s s365">They were full of   
long words that our teacher wouldn't have used.</span> <span class="s s366">Where had these   
questions come from?</span> <span class="s s367">From the Cliff's Notes, it turned out.</span> <span class="s s368">The 
teacher was using them too.</span> <span class="s s369">We were all just pretending.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s371">There are certainly great public school teachers.</span>  <span class="s s372">The energy and 
imagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that  
year something his students still talk about, thirty years later.</span>
<span class="s s373">But teachers like him were individuals swimming
upstream.</span> <span class="s s374">They couldn't fix the system.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s376">In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy.</span>
<span class="s s377">When groups of adults form in the real world, it's generally for  
some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best
at it.</span> <span class="s s378">The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose.</span> 
<span class="s s379">But hierarchy there must be.</span>
<span class="s s380">And so the kids make one out of nothing.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s382">We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be
created without any meaningful criteria.</span><span class="s s383"> We say that the situation
    <i>
     degenerates into a popularity contest.
    </i>
    And that's exactly what
happens in most American schools.</span>
<span class="s s384">Instead of depending on some real test, one's rank
depends mostly on one's ability to increase one's rank.</span> <span class="s s385">It's
like the court of Louis XIV.</span> <span class="s s386">There is no external opponent, so the
kids become one another's opponents.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s388">When there is some real external test of skill, it isn't painful
to be at the bottom of the hierarchy.</span> <span class="s s389">A rookie on a football team
doesn't resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him
one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him.</span><span class="s s390">
The veteran may in turn feel a sense of
    <i>
     noblesse oblige
    </i>
    .</span>
<span class="s s391">And most importantly, their status depends on how well they
do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s393">Court hierarchies are another thing entirely.</span> <span class="s s394">This type of society
debases anyone who enters it.</span><span class="s s395"> There is neither admiration at the 
bottom, nor
    <i>
     noblesse oblige
    </i>
    at the top.</span> <span class="s s396">It's kill or be killed.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s398">This is the sort of society that gets created
in American
secondary schools.</span> <span class="s s399">And it happens because these schools have no
real purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain
number of hours each day.</span> <span class="s s400">What I didn't realize at the time, and
in fact didn't realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors
of school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same  
cause.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s402">The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences
than just making kids unhappy for six years.</span> <span class="s s403">It breeds a rebelliousness
that actively drives kids away from the things they're supposed to
be learning.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s405">Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I
could bring myself to read anything we'd been assigned then.</span>
<span class="s s406">And I lost more than books.</span> <span class="s s407">I mistrusted words like "character" and   
"integrity" because they had been so debased by adults.</span> <span class="s s408">As they
were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing:
obedience.</span> <span class="s s409">The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to 
be at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers.</span>
<span class="s s410">If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of
them.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s412">The word I most misunderstood was "tact.</span><span class="s s413">"</span> <span class="s s414">As used by adults, it
seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut.</span>
<span class="s s415">I assumed it was derived from the same root as
"tacit" and "taciturn," and that it literally meant being quiet.</span> <span class="s s416">I
vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut
me up.</span> <span class="s s417">In fact, it's derived from the same root as "tactile," and
what it means is to have a deft touch.</span> <span class="s s418">Tactful is the opposite of
clumsy.</span> <span class="s s419">I don't think I learned this until college.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s421">Nerds aren't the only losers in the popularity rat race.</span> <span class="s s422">Nerds are
unpopular because they're distracted.</span> <span class="s s423">There are other kids who
deliberately opt out because they're so disgusted with the whole  
process.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s425">Teenage kids, even rebels, don't like to be alone, so when kids opt
out of the system, they tend to do it as a group.</span> <span class="s s426">At the schools I
went to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana.</span>
<span class="s s427">The kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called
"freaks.</span><span class="s s428">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s430">Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap
between them.</span> <span class="s s431">Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids,
though never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an   
important tribal value.</span> <span class="s s432">I was more in the nerd camp, but I was
friends with a lot of freaks.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s434">They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they
created.</span> <span class="s s435">It was something to do together, and because the drugs 
were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s437">I'm not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get
into trouble with drugs.</span> <span class="s s438">After a while, drugs have their own momentum.</span>
<span class="s s439">No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from  
other problems-- trouble at home, for example.</span><span class="s s440"> But, in my school
at least, the reason most kids
    <i>
     started
    </i>
    using drugs was rebellion.</span>
<span class="s s441">Fourteen-year-olds didn't start smoking pot because they'd heard
it would help them forget their problems. They started because they
wanted to join a different tribe.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s443">Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea.</span> <span class="s s444">And yet the
authorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves
the cause of the problem.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s446">The real problem is the emptiness of school life.</span> <span class="s s447">We won't see
solutions till adults realize that.</span> <span class="s s448">The adults who
may realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in  
school.</span> <span class="s s449">Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as
you were?</span> <span class="s s450">I wouldn't.</span> <span class="s s451">Well, then, is there anything we can do to
fix things?</span> <span class="s s452">Almost certainly.</span> <span class="s s453">There is nothing inevitable about the
current system.</span> <span class="s s454">It has come about mostly by default.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s456">Adults, though, are busy.</span> <span class="s s457">Showing up for school plays is one thing.</span>
<span class="s s458">Taking on the educational bureaucracy is another.</span> <span class="s s459">Perhaps a few
will have the energy to try to change things.</span> <span class="s s460">I suspect the hardest  
part is realizing that you can.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s462">Nerds still in school should not hold their breath.</span> <span class="s s463">Maybe one day
a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to      
rescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month.</span> <span class="s s464">Any     
immediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to
come from the nerds themselves.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s466">Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less 
painful.</span> <span class="s s467">Nerds aren't losers.</span> <span class="s s468">They're just playing a different game,
and a game much closer to the one played in the real world.</span> <span class="s s469">Adults
know this.</span> <span class="s s470">It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim
to have been nerds in high school.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s472">It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life.</span>
<span class="s s473">School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral.</span>
<span class="s s474">It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing.</span> <span class="s s475">It's
only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while
you're still in it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s477">If life seems awful to kids, it's neither because hormones are 
turning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because
life actually is awful (as you believe).</span> <span class="s s478">It's because the adults,
who no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to
spend years cooped up together with nothing real to do.</span><span class="s s479">
    <i>
     Any
    </i>
    society
of that type is awful to live in.</span>
<span class="s s480">You don't have
to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s482">I've said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis
is an optimistic one-- that several problems we take for granted
are in fact not insoluble after all.</span> <span class="s s483">Teenage kids are not inherently
unhappy monsters.</span> <span class="s s484">That should be encouraging news to kids and adults
both.</span>
