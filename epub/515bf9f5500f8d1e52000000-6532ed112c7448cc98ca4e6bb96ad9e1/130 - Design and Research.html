  <p>
   <span class="s s4">Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that
Americans like to begin a conversation by asking "what do you do?</span><span class="s s5">"</span>
<span class="s s6">I've never liked this question.</span>  <span class="s s7">I've rarely had a
neat answer to it.</span>  <span class="s s8">But I think I have finally solved the problem.</span><span class="s s9">
Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight
in the eye and say "I'm designing a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/arc.html">
    new dialect of Lisp
   </a>
   .</span><span class="s s10">"</span>   
<span class="s s11">I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being asked what
they do.</span>  <span class="s s12">The conversation will turn immediately to other topics.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">I don't consider myself to be doing research on programming languages.</span>
<span class="s s15">I'm just designing one, in the same way that someone might design
a building or a chair or a new typeface.</span>
<span class="s s16">I'm not trying to discover anything new.</span>  <span class="s s17">I just want
to make a language that will be good to program in.</span>  <span class="s s18">In some ways,
this assumption makes life a lot easier.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s20">The difference between design and research seems to be a question
of new versus good.</span>  <span class="s s21">Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to  
be good.</span>  <span class="s s22">Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new.</span>
<span class="s s23">I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design
surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research
solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.</span>
<span class="s s24">So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching
it from different directions.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s26">What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like
from the back.</span>  <span class="s s27">What do you do differently when you treat
programming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s29">The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user.</span>
<span class="s s30">Design begins by asking, who is this
for and what do they need from it?</span>  <span class="s s31">A good architect,
for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then
imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring
out what they need.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s33">Notice I said "what they need," not "what they want.</span><span class="s s34">"</span>  <span class="s s35">I don't mean
to give the impression that working as a designer means working as 
a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells you
to.</span>  <span class="s s36">This varies from field to field in the arts, but
I don't think there is any field in which the best work is done by
the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s38">
   The customer
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   always right in
the sense that the measure of good design is how well it works
for the user.</span>  <span class="s s39">If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chair
that's horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you've done a bad
job, period.</span>  <span class="s s40">It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair  
is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s42">And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making
what the user tells you to.</span>  <span class="s s43">Users don't know what all the choices
are, and are often mistaken about what they really want.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s45">The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design
for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply  
what he says he wants.</span>
<span class="s s46">It's much like being a doctor.</span>  <span class="s s47">You can't just treat a patient's
symptoms.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure
out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s49">This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the
practice of good design can be derived, and around which most design
issues center.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?</span>  <span class="s s52">When
I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good 
design aims at some kind of  
lowest common denominator.</span>  <span class="s s53">You can pick any group of users you
want.</span>  <span class="s s54">If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it
for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design
for one group might be bad for another.</span>  <span class="s s55">The point
is, you have to pick some group of users.</span>  <span class="s s56">I don't think you can
even talk about good or bad design except with
reference to some intended user.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s58">You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include
the designer himself.</span>  <span class="s s59">When you design something
for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people
you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s61">That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently,
seems inevitably to corrupt the designer.</span>
<span class="s s62">I suspect that very few housing
projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live
in them.</span>   <span class="s s63">You can see the same thing
in programming languages.</span>  <span class="s s64">C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for
their own designers to use.</span>  <span class="s s65">Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created   
for other people to use.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s67">
   If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are
that you're not designing something good, even for idiots.
  </span></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s68">Even if you're designing something for the most sophisticated
users, though, you're still designing for humans.</span>  <span class="s s69">It's different 
in research.</span>  <span class="s s70">In math you
don't choose abstractions because they're
easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the
proof shorter.</span>  <span class="s s71">I think this is true for the sciences generally.</span>
<span class="s s72">Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s74">Over in the arts, things are very different.</span>  <span class="s s75">Design is
all about people.</span>  <span class="s s76">The human body is a strange
thing, but when you're designing a chair,
that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it.</span>
<span class="s s77">All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations
of humans.</span>   <span class="s s78">In painting, for example, all other things being
equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than
one without.</span>  <span class="s s79">It is not merely an accident of history that
the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.</span>
<span class="s s80">If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige
that it does.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s82">Like it or not, programming languages are also for people,
and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic
as the human body.</span>  <span class="s s83">Some ideas are easy for people to grasp
and some aren't.</span>  <span class="s s84">For example, we seem to have a very limited
capacity for dealing with detail.</span>  <span class="s s85">It's this fact that makes
programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we
could handle the detail, we could just program in machine
language.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">Remember, too, that languages are not
primarily a form for finished programs, but something that
programs have to be developed in.</span>  <span class="s s88">Anyone in the arts could
tell you that you might want different mediums for the
two situations.</span>  <span class="s s89">Marble, for example, is a nice, durable
medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one
for developing new ideas.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s91">A program, like a proof,
is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had
false starts branching off all over it.</span>  <span class="s s92">So the test of
a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks
in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.</span>
<span class="s s93">A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs
may not give you an elegant design process.</span>  <span class="s s94">For example, 
I've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested
backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them
took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still
not entirely sure they're correct.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s96">We often act as if the test of a language were how good
finished programs look in it.</span>
<span class="s s97">It seems so convincing when you see the same program
written in two languages, and one version is much shorter.</span>
<span class="s s98">When you approach the problem from the direction of the
arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of
test.</span>  <span class="s s99">You don't want to end up with a programming
language like marble.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s101">For example, it is a huge win in developing software to
have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a
read-eval-print loop.</span>  <span class="s s102">And when you have one this has
real effects on the design of the language.</span>  <span class="s s103">It would not
work well for a language where you have to declare
variables before using them, for example.</span>  <span class="s s104">When you're
just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be 
able to set x to some value and then start doing things
to x.</span>  <span class="s s105">You don't want to have to declare the type of x
first.</span>  <span class="s s106">You may dispute either of the premises, but if
a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and
mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a
toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations  
mandatory could be convenient to program in.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s108">In practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stay
close, to your users.</span>  <span class="s s109">You have to calibrate your ideas on actual
users constantly, especially in the beginning.</span>  <span class="s s110">One of the reasons
Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to
her family.</span>  <span class="s s111">That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty
descriptions of landscapes,
or pretentious philosophizing.</span>  <span class="s s112">(The philosophy's there, but it's
woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.</span><span class="s s113">)
If you open an average "literary" novel and imagine reading it out loud
to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too
keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s115">In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better.</span>
<span class="s s116">Actually, there are several ideas mixed together in the concept of
Worse is Better, which is why people are still arguing about
whether worse
is actually better or not.</span>  <span class="s s117">But one of the main ideas in that
mix is that if you're building something new, you should get a
prototype in front of users as soon as possible.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s119">The alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy.</span>
<span class="s s120">Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining
it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long
touchdown pass.</span>  <span class="s s121">As far as I know, this is a
recipe for disaster.</span>  <span class="s s122">Countless startups destroyed themselves this
way during the Internet bubble.</span>  <span class="s s123">I've never heard of a case
where it worked.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s125">What people outside the software world may not realize is that
Worse is Better is found throughout the arts.</span>
<span class="s s126">In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the
Renaissance.</span>  <span class="s s127">Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you that
the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to
work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will
accumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet.</span>
<span class="s s128">Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place,
and then gradually refine this initial sketch.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s130">In most fields, prototypes
have traditionally been made out of different materials.</span>
<span class="s s131">Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed  
with a brush on paper.</span>  <span class="s s132">Statues to be cast in bronze   
were modelled in wax.</span>  <span class="s s133">Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries
were drawn on paper with ink wash.</span>  <span class="s s134">Buildings to be
constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s136">
   What made oil paint so exciting, when it
first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you
could actually make the finished work
   <i>
    from
   </i>
   the prototype.</span>
<span class="s s137">You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you
weren't held to it; you could work out all the details, and
even make major changes, as you finished the painting.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s139">You can do this in software too.</span>  <span class="s s140">A prototype doesn't have to
be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.</span>
<span class="s s141">I think you should always do this when you can.</span>  <span class="s s142">It lets you
take advantage of new insights you have along the way.</span>  <span class="s s143">But
perhaps even more important, it's good for morale.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s145">Morale is key in design.</span>  <span class="s s146">I'm surprised people
don't talk more about it.</span>  <span class="s s147">One of my first
drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're
drawing something, the drawing will look boring.</span>
<span class="s s148">For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you
decide to draw each brick individually.</span>  <span class="s s149">You can do this
if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start
making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,   
the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested
the bricks.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s151">Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good
for morale because it keeps you engaged.</span>  <span class="s s152">In software, my  
rule is: always have working code.</span>  <span class="s s153">If you're writing
something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you
have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.</span>
<span class="s s154">The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.</span>
<span class="s s155">Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually
refine it.</span>
<span class="s s156">If you work this way, then in principle
you never have to end the day with something that actually
looks unfinished.</span>  <span class="s s157">Indeed, there is even a saying among
painters: "A painting is never finished, you just stop
working on it.</span><span class="s s158">"</span>  <span class="s s159">This idea will be familiar to anyone who
has worked on software.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s161">Morale is another reason that it's hard to design something
for an unsophisticated user.</span>   <span class="s s162">It's hard to stay interested in
something you don't like yourself.</span>  <span class="s s163">To make something  
good, you have to be thinking, "wow, this is really great,"
not "what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.</span><span class="s s164">"</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s166">
   Design means making things for humans.  But it's not just the
user who's human.  The designer is human too.
  </span></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s167">Notice all this time I've been talking about "the designer.</span><span class="s s168">"</span>
<span class="s s169">Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to
be any good.</span>   <span class="s s170">And yet it seems to be possible for several people
to collaborate on a research project.</span>  <span class="s s171">This seems to
me one of the most interesting differences between research and
design.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s173">There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts,
but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather
than nuclear fusion.</span>  <span class="s s174">In an opera it's common for one person to
write the libretto and another to write the music.</span>   <span class="s s175">And during the Renaissance, 
journeymen from northern
Europe were often employed to do the landscapes in the
backgrounds of Italian paintings.</span>  <span class="s s176">But these aren't true collaborations.</span>
<span class="s s177">They're more like examples of Robert Frost's
"good fences make good neighbors.</span><span class="s s178">"</span>  <span class="s s179">You can stick instances
of good design together, but within each individual project,
one person has to be in control.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s181">I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think
of everything.</span>  <span class="s s182">There's nothing more valuable than the advice
of someone whose judgement you trust.</span>  <span class="s s183">But after the talking is
done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s185">Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  
design can't?</span>  <span class="s s186">This is an interesting question.</span>  <span class="s s187">I don't 
know the answer.</span>  <span class="s s188">Perhaps,
if design and research converge, the best research is also
good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.</span>
<span class="s s189">A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.</span>
<span class="s s190">But I don't know enough to say whether there
is a pattern here.</span>  <span class="s s191">It could be simply that many famous scientists
worked when collaboration was less common.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s193">Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration
seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.</span>  <span class="s s194">Design by committee is a
synonym for bad design.</span>  <span class="s s195">Why is that so?</span>  <span class="s s196">Is there some way to
beat this limitation?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s198">I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires
a dictator.</span>  <span class="s s199">One reason is that good design has to   
be all of a piece.</span>  <span class="s s200">Design is not just for humans, but
for individual humans.</span>  <span class="s s201">If a design represents an idea that  
fits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's
head too.</span>
