   A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the
biggest
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html">
    regrets
of the dying
   </a>
   .</span>  <span class="s s4">Her list seems plausible.</span><span class="s s5">  I could see
myself&acirc;&#128;&#148;
   <i>
    can
   </i>
   see myself&acirc;&#128;&#148;making at least 4 of these
5 mistakes.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s7">If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might
be: don't be a cog.</span>  <span class="s s8">The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial
man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances,
then turns dutifully till he stops.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s10">The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are
all errors of omission.</span>  <span class="s s11">You forget your dreams, ignore your family,
suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be
happy.</span>  <span class="s s12">Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of
mistake, because you make them by default.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s14">I would like to avoid making these mistakes.</span>  <span class="s s15">But how do you avoid
mistakes you make by default?</span>  <span class="s s16">Ideally you transform your life so
it has other defaults.</span>  <span class="s s17">But it may not be possible to do that
completely.</span> <span class="s s18">As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably
have to be reminded not to make them.</span>  <span class="s s19">So I inverted the 5 regrets,
yielding a list of 5 commands</span>
   </p><blockquote><span class="s s20">
    Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you
   think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
   </span></blockquote><span class="s s21">
   which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.
