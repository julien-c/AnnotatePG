   Stuff
  </span></h1>
  <h2><span class="s s2">

  </span></h2>
  <p>
   <span class="s s3">I have too much stuff.</span>  <span class="s s4">Most people in America do.</span>  <span class="s s5">In fact, the
poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.</span>  <span class="s s6">Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s8">It wasn't always this way.</span>  <span class="s s9">Stuff used to be rare and valuable.</span>
<span class="s s10">You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.</span>  <span class="s s11">For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don't have closets.</span>  <span class="s s12">In those days people's stuff fit in a chest
of drawers.</span>  <span class="s s13">Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot
less stuff.</span>  <span class="s s14">When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised
how empty houses look.</span>  <span class="s s15">As a kid I had what I thought was a huge
fleet of toy cars, but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my
nephews have.</span>  <span class="s s16">All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about
a third of the surface of my bed.</span>  <span class="s s17">In my nephews' rooms the bed is
the only clear space.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s19">
   Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven't
changed correspondingly.  We overvalue stuff.
  </span></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s20">That was a big problem
for me when I had no money.</span>  <span class="s s21">I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,
so almost instinctively I accumulated it.</span>  <span class="s s22">Friends would leave
something behind when they moved, or I'd see something as I was
walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find
yourself describing as "perfectly good"), or I'd find something in
almost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale.</span>
<span class="s s23">And pow, more stuff.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s25">In fact these free or nearly free things weren't bargains, because
they were worth even less than they cost.</span>  <span class="s s26">Most of the stuff I
accumulated was worthless, because I didn't need it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s28">What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition
wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for
it.</span>  <span class="s s29">It was the value I derived from it.</span>  <span class="s s30">Stuff is an extremely
illiquid asset.</span>  <span class="s s31">Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable
thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's
"worth?</span><span class="s s32">"</span>  <span class="s s33">The only way you're ever going to extract any value from
it is to use it.</span>  <span class="s s34">And if you don't have any immediate use for it,
you probably never will.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s36">Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think
stuff is still valuable.</span>  <span class="s s37">But it would be closer to the truth to
treat stuff as worthless.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s39">In fact, worse than worthless, because once you've accumulated a
certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other
way around.</span>  <span class="s s40">I know of one couple who couldn't retire to the town
they preferred because they couldn't afford a place there big enough
for all their stuff.</span>  <span class="s s41">Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s43">And unless you're extremely organized, a house full of stuff can
be very depressing.</span> <span class="s s44">A cluttered room saps one's spirits.</span>  <span class="s s45">One
reason, obviously, is that there's less room for people in a room
full of stuff.</span>  <span class="s s46">But there's more going on than that.</span>  <span class="s s47">I think humans
constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's
around them.</span>  <span class="s s48">And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy
you have left for conscious thoughts.</span>  <span class="s s49">A cluttered room is literally
exhausting.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s51">(This could explain why clutter doesn't seem to bother kids as much
as adults.</span> <span class="s s52">Kids are less perceptive.</span>  <span class="s s53">They build a coarser model
of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.</span><span class="s s54">)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s55">I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy
for a year.</span>  <span class="s s56">All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff.</span>
<span class="s s57">The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady's attic back in the US.</span>
<span class="s s58">And you know what?</span>  <span class="s s59">All I missed were some of the books.</span>  <span class="s s60">By the
end of the year I couldn't even remember what else I had stored in
that attic.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s62">And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it.</span>
<span class="s s63">Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone?</span>  <span class="s s64">I might need that
one day.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s66">The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated
all this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately
needed on stuff that I didn't.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s68">Why would I do that?</span>  <span class="s s69">Because the people whose job is to sell you
stuff are really, really good at it.</span>  <span class="s s70">The average 25 year old is
no match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to
get you to spend money on stuff.</span>  <span class="s s71">They make the experience of buying
stuff so pleasant that "shopping" becomes a leisure activity.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s73">How do you protect yourself from these people?</span>  <span class="s s74">It can't be easy.</span>
<span class="s s75">I'm a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well
into my thirties.</span>  <span class="s s76">But one thing that might work is to ask yourself,
before buying something, "is this going to make my life noticeably
better?</span><span class="s s77">"</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s79">A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking
herself before she bought anything "Am I going to wear this all the
time?</span><span class="s s80">"</span>  <span class="s s81">If she couldn't convince herself that something she was
thinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore
all the time, she wouldn't buy it.</span>  <span class="s s82">I think that would work for any
kind of purchase.</span>  <span class="s s83">Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this
be something I use constantly?</span>  <span class="s s84">Or is it just something nice?</span>  <span class="s s85">Or
worse still, a mere bargain?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s87">The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don't use much
because it's too good.</span>  <span class="s s88">Nothing owns you like fragile stuff.</span>  <span class="s s89">For
example, the "good china" so many households have, and whose defining
quality is not so much that it's fun to use, but that one must be
especially careful not to break it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s91">Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall
cost of owning it.</span>  <span class="s s92">The purchase price is just the beginning.</span><span class="s s93">  You're
going to have to
   <i>
    think
   </i>
   about that thing for years&mdash;perhaps for
the rest of your life.</span>  <span class="s s94">Every thing you own takes energy away from
you.</span>  <span class="s s95">Some give more than they take.</span>  <span class="s s96">Those are the only things
worth having.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="s s98">
   I've now stopped accumulating stuff.  Except books&mdash;but books are
different.  Books are more like a fluid than individual objects.
It's not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books,
whereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you'd be
a local celebrity.  But except for books, I now actively avoid
stuff.  If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I'll take

    </span></xa></xa></p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s101">I'm not claiming this is because I've achieved some kind of zenlike
detachment from material things.</span>  <span class="s s102">I'm talking about something more
mundane.</span>  <span class="s s103">A historical change has taken place, and I've now realized
it.</span>  <span class="s s104">Stuff used to be valuable, and now it's not.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s106">In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in
the middle of the twentieth century.</span>  <span class="s s107">As food got cheaper (or we
got richer; they're indistinguishable), eating too much started to
be a bigger danger than eating too little.</span>   <span class="s s108">We've now reached that
point with stuff.</span>  <span class="s s109">For most people, rich or poor, stuff has become
a burden.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s111">The good news is, if you're carrying a burden without knowing it,
your life could be better than you realize.</span>  <span class="s s112">Imagine walking around
for years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having them
removed.</span>
