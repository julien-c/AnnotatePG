    Taste for Makers
   </span></h1>

    February 2002
   </span></p>
   <p>
    </p><table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="500"><tr></tr></table><p>
    <span class="s s3">I was talking recently to a friend who teaches
at MIT.</span>  <span class="s s4">His field is hot now and
every year he is inundated by applications from
would-be graduate students.</span>  <span class="s s5">"A lot of them seem smart,"
he said.</span>  <span class="s s6">"What I can't tell is whether they have any kind
of taste.</span><span class="s s7">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s9">Taste.</span>  <span class="s s10">You don't hear that word much now.</span>
<span class="s s11">And yet we still need the underlying
concept, whatever we call it.</span>  <span class="s s12">What my friend meant was
that he wanted students who were not just good technicians,
but who could use their technical knowledge to
design beautiful things.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s14">Mathematicians call good work "beautiful,"
and so, either now or in the past, have
scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers,
writers, and painters.</span>
<span class="s s15">Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is   
there some overlap in what they meant?</span>  <span class="s s16">If there
is an overlap, can we use one field's discoveries
about beauty to help us in another?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s18">For those of us who design things, these are not just
theoretical questions.</span>  <span class="s s19">If there is such a thing as
beauty, we need to be able to recognize it.</span>  <span class="s s20">We need
good taste to make good things.</span><span class="s s21">
Instead of
treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered
about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy
abstractions, let's try considering it as a practical question:
    <i>
     how do you make good stuff?
    </i>
   </span></p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s22">If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell
you that "taste is subjective.</span><span class="s s23">"</span>
<span class="s s24">They believe this because it really feels that
way to them.</span>  <span class="s s25">When they like something, they have no idea
why.</span>  <span class="s s26">It could be because it's beautiful, or because their
mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one
in a magazine, or because they know it's expensive.</span>
<span class="s s27">Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s29">Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle
unexamined.</span>  <span class="s s30">If you make fun of your little brother for
coloring people green in his coloring book, your
mother is likely to tell you something like "you like to
do it your way and he likes to do it his way.</span><span class="s s31">"</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s33">Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you
important truths about aesthetics.</span>  <span class="s s34">She's trying to get
the two of you to stop bickering.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s36">Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one
contradicts other things they tell us.</span>  <span class="s s37">After dinning
into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference,
they take you to the museum and tell you that you should
pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s39">What goes through the kid's head at this point?</span>  <span class="s s40">What does
he think "great artist" means?</span><span class="s s41">  After having been
told for years that everyone just likes to do
things their own way, he is
unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great
artist is someone whose work is
    <i>
     better
    </i>
    than the others'.</span>
<span class="s s42">A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of
the universe, is that a great artist is something that's
good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s44">Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way
to prevent disputes.</span>  <span class="s s45">The trouble is, it's not true.</span>
<span class="s s46">You feel this when you start to design things.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s48">Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better.</span>
<span class="s s49">Football players
like to win games.</span>  <span class="s s50">CEOs like to increase earnings.</span>  <span class="s s51">It's
a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at
your job.</span><span class="s s52"> But if
your job is to design things, and there is no such thing
as beauty, then there is
    <i>
     no way to get better at your job.
    </i>
    If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is   
already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s54">As in any job, as you continue to design things, you'll get
better at it.</span>  <span class="s s55">Your tastes will change.</span>  <span class="s s56">And, like anyone
who gets better at their job, you'll know you're getting
better.</span>  <span class="s s57">If so,
your old tastes were
not merely different, but worse.</span>  <span class="s s58">Poof goes the axiom that
taste can't be wrong.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s60">Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper
you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows.</span>
<span class="s s61">But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself,
that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you
can start to study good design in detail.</span>
<span class="s s62">How has
your taste changed?</span>  <span class="s s63">When you made mistakes, what
caused you to make them?</span>  <span class="s s64">What have other people learned about
design?</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s66">Once you start to examine the question, it's surprising how
much different fields' ideas of beauty have in common.</span>  <span class="s s67">The same
principles of good design crop up again and again.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <span class="s s69">Good design is simple.</span>
    <span class="s s70">You hear this from math to
painting.</span>  <span class="s s71">In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be
a better one.</span>  <span class="s s72">Where axioms are concerned, especially,
less is more.</span>  <span class="s s73">It means much the same thing in programming.</span>
<span class="s s74">For architects and designers it means that beauty should
depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements
rather than a profusion of superficial ornament.</span>  <span class="s s75">(Ornament
is not in itself bad, only when it's camouflage on insipid
form.</span><span class="s s76">)  Similarly, in painting, a
still life of a few carefully observed and solidly
modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a
stretch of flashy
but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar.</span>
<span class="s s77">In writing it means: say what you mean
and say it briefly.</span>
   </h3>
  
  <p>
   <span class="s s79">It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity.</span>
<span class="s s80">You'd think simple would be the default.</span>  <span class="s s81">Ornate
is more work.</span>  <span class="s s82">But something seems to come over people
when they try to be creative.</span>  <span class="s s83">Beginning writers adopt   
a pompous tone that doesn't sound anything like the way 
they speak.</span>  <span class="s s84">Designers trying to be artistic resort to
swooshes and curlicues.</span>  <span class="s s85">Painters discover that they're expressionists.</span>
<span class="s s86">It's all evasion.</span>
<span class="s s87">Underneath
the long words or the "expressive" brush strokes, there
is not much going on, and that's frightening.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="s s89">When you're
forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem.</span>
<span class="s s90">When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver
substance.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
   <span class="s s92">Good design is timeless.</span>
   <span class="s s93">In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake.</span>
<span class="s s94">So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent 
place for ugly mathematics?</span>  <span class="s s95">He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did:
if something is ugly, it can't be the best solution.</span>  <span class="s s96">There
must be a better one, and eventually
someone will discover it.</span>
   </h3><p>
    <span class="s s98">Aiming at timelessness is a way to make
yourself find the best answer:
if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.</span>
<span class="s s99">Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they
left little room for those who came after.</span>
<span class="s s100">Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s102">Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade
the grip of fashion.</span>  <span class="s s103">Fashions almost by definition
change with time, so if you can make something that
will still look good far into the future, then its
appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="s s105">Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will 
appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to
try to appeal to past generations.</span>  <span class="s s106">It's hard to guess what
the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be
like the past in caring nothing for present fashions.</span>
<span class="s s107">So if you can make something that appeals to people today
and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good
chance it will appeal to people in 2500.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <span class="s s109">Good design solves the right problem.</span>
    <span class="s s110">The typical
stove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial
to control each.</span>  <span class="s s111">How do you arrange the dials?</span>  <span class="s s112">The
simplest answer is to put them in a row.</span>  <span class="s s113">But this is a
simple answer to the wrong question.</span>
<span class="s s114">The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row,
the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time
about which dial matches which burner.</span>  <span class="s s115">Better to arrange the dials
in a square like the burners.</span>
    </h3><p>
     <span class="s s117">A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided.</span>
<span class="s s118">In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for
setting text in sans-serif fonts.</span><span class="s s119">
These fonts
     <i>
      are
     </i>
     closer to the pure, underlying letterforms.
But in text that's not the problem you're trying to solve.</span> 
<span class="s s120">For legibility it's more important that letters be easy
to tell apart.</span>
<span class="s s121">It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is
easy to tell from a lowercase y.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="s s123">Problems can be improved as well as solutions.</span>
<span class="s s124">In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced
by an equivalent one that's easy to solve.</span>
<span class="s s125">Physics progressed faster as the problem became
predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it
with scripture.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>
     <span class="s s127">Good design is suggestive.</span>
     <span class="s s128">Jane Austen's novels contain almost no
description; instead of telling you how
everything looks, she tells her story so well that you   
envision the scene for yourself.</span>
<span class="s s129">Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging
than one that tells.</span>  <span class="s s130">Everyone makes up their own story about the
Mona Lisa.</span>
     </h3><p>
      <span class="s s132">In architecture and design, this
principle means that a building or object should let you 
use it how you want: a good building, for example, will
serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead
of making them live as if they were executing a program
written by the architect.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="s s134">In software, it means you should give users a few
basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego.</span> 
<span class="s s135">In math it means a proof that
becomes the basis for a lot of new work is
preferable to a proof that was difficult,
but doesn't lead to future discoveries; in the
sciences generally, citation is considered a rough
indicator of merit.</span>
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h3>
      <span class="s s137">Good design is often slightly funny.</span>
      <span class="s s138">This one
may not always be true.</span><span class="s s139">  But Durer's
      <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/pilate.html">
       engravings
      </a>
      and Saarinen's
      <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/womb.html">
       womb chair
      </a>
      and the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/pantheon.html">
       Pantheon
      </a>
      and the
original
      <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/1974-911s.html">
       Porsche 911
      </a>
      all seem
to me slightly funny.</span>  <span class="s s140">Godel's incompleteness theorem
seems like a practical joke.</span>
      </h3><p>
       <span class="s s142">I think it's because humor is related to strength.</span>
<span class="s s143">To have a sense of humor is to be strong:
to keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes,
and to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them.</span>
<span class="s s144">And so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strength
is not to take
oneself too seriously.</span>
<span class="s s145">The confident will often, like
swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly,
as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- or
Shakespeare, for that matter.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span class="s s147">Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to
imagine something that could be called humorless also being
good design.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
       <span class="s s149">Good design is hard.</span>
       <span class="s s150">If you look at the people who've
done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they
worked very hard.</span>  <span class="s s151">If you're not working hard,
you're probably wasting your time.</span>
       </h3><p>
        <span class="s s153">Hard problems call for great
efforts.</span>  <span class="s s154">In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions,
and those tend to be interesting.</span>  <span class="s s155">Ditto in engineering.</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span class="s s157">When you
have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary
out of your pack.</span>  <span class="s s158">And so an architect who has to build
on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he
is forced to produce an elegant design.</span>  <span class="s s159">Fashions and
flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business
of solving the problem at all.</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span class="s s161">Not every kind of hard is good.</span>  <span class="s s162">There is good pain and bad pain.</span>
<span class="s s163">You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the
kind you get from stepping on a nail.</span>
<span class="s s164">A difficult
problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable
materials would not be.</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span class="s s166">In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to
paintings of people.</span>  <span class="s s167">There is something to this tradition,
and not just because pictures of faces get to press
buttons in our brains that other pictures don't.</span>  <span class="s s168">We are 
so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who
draws them to work hard to satisfy us.</span>  <span class="s s169">If you
draw a tree and you change the angle of a branch
five degrees, no one will know.</span>  <span class="s s170">When you change the angle
of someone's eye five degrees, people notice.</span>
       </p>
       <p><span class="s s172">
        When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan's "form follows function,"
what they meant was, form
        <i>
         should
        </i>
        follow function.</span>  <span class="s s173">And
if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it,
because there is no effort to spare for error.</span>  <span class="s s174">Wild animals
are beautiful because they have hard lives.</span>
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        <span class="s s176">Good design looks easy.</span>
        <span class="s s177">Like great athletes,
great designers make it look easy.</span>  <span class="s s178">Mostly this is
an illusion.</span>  <span class="s s179">The easy, conversational tone of good
writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.</span>
        </h3><p>
         <span class="s s181">In science and engineering, some of the greatest
discoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself,
I could have thought of that.</span>  <span class="s s182">The discoverer is
entitled to reply, why didn't you?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s184">Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines.</span>  <span class="s s185">You look
at them and you think, all you have to do is get eight
or ten lines in the right place and you've made this beautiful
portrait.</span><span class="s s186">  Well, yes, but you have to get them in
         <i>
          exactly
         </i>
         the right place.</span>  <span class="s s187">The slightest error
will make the whole thing collapse.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s189">Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual
medium, because they demand near perfection.</span>
<span class="s s190">In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser  
artists literally solve the same problems by successive
approximation.</span>  <span class="s s191">One of the reasons kids give up drawing
at ten or so is that they decide to start
drawing like grownups, and one of the first things
they try is a line drawing of a face.</span>  <span class="s s192">Smack!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s194">In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with
practice.</span>  <span class="s s195">Perhaps what practice does is train your
unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to
require conscious thought.</span>  <span class="s s196">In some cases
you literally train your body.</span>  <span class="s s197">An expert pianist can
play notes faster than the brain can send signals to
his hand.</span>  
<span class="s s198">Likewise an artist, after a while, can
make visual perception flow in through his eye and
out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to
a beat.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span class="s s200">When people talk about being in
"the zone," I think what they mean is that the
spinal cord has the situation under control.</span>
<span class="s s201">Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and
it frees conscious thought for the hard problems.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         <span class="s s202">Good design uses symmetry.</span>
         <span class="s s203">I think symmetry may just
be one way to achieve simplicity, but it's important enough
to be mentioned on its own.</span>
<span class="s s204">Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.</span>
         </h3><p>
          <span class="s s206">There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.</span>
<span class="s s207">Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the
pattern of veins in a leaf.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span class="s s209">Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to
excesses in the past.</span>  <span class="s s210">Architects started consciously
making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the
1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture.</span>
<span class="s s211">Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric
about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span class="s s213">In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases
in a sentence to the plot of a novel.</span>  <span class="s s214">You find the same
in music and art.</span><span class="s s215">
Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making
the whole picture out of the same atoms.  Compositional 
symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings,  
especially when two halves react to one another, as in 
the
          <i>
           <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/symptg.html">
            Creation of Adam
           </a>
          </i>
          or
          <i>
           <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/symptg.html">
            American Gothic
           </a>
           .
          </i>
         </span></p>
         <p>
          <span class="s s216">In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win.</span>
<span class="s s217">Inductive proofs are wonderfully short.</span>  <span class="s s218">In software,
a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always
best solved that way.</span> <span class="s s219">The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly
because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.</span>
         </p>
         <p><span class="s s221">
          The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that
it can be used as a substitute for thought.
         </span></p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <h3>
          <span class="s s222">Good design resembles nature.</span>

early aircraft designers were mistaken to
design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn't

            When people first start drawing, for example,
they're often reluctant to redo parts that aren't
right; they feel they've been lucky to get that far,   
and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse.</span>  <span class="s s248">Instead
they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad,

often make a round trip.</span>  <span class="s s265">A novice
imitates without knowing it; next he tries
consciously to be original; finally, he decides it's
more important to be right than original.</span>

right answer has already been discovered by someone else,
that's no reason not to use it.</span>

feeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.</span>

most of all to develop a personal style.</span>
<span class="s s292">But if you just try to make good things, you'll  
inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person
walks in a distinctive way.</span>  <span class="s s293">Michelangelo was not trying

Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, 
Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo.</span>

<span class="s s308">And it can't have been heredity, because it isn't happening now.</span>
<span class="s s309">You have to assume that whatever
inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were
people born in Milan with just as much.</span>  <span class="s s310">What happened to
the Milanese Leonardo?</span>
              </p>
              <p>
               <span class="s s312">There are roughly a thousand times
as many people alive in the US right now as lived in
Florence during the fifteenth century.</span>  <span class="s s313">A thousand Leonardos
and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us.</span>
<span class="s s314">If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic
marvels.</span>  <span class="s s315">We aren't, and the reason is that to make Leonardo
you need more than his innate ability.</span>  <span class="s s316">You also need Florence 
in 1450.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
               <span class="s s318">Nothing is more powerful
than a community of talented people working on related
problems.  Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic
Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born   
near Milan instead of Florence.</span><span class="s s319">
Today we move around more, but great work still comes
disproportionately from a few hotspots:

              <p>
               <span class="s s321">At any given time there are a
few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them,
and it's nearly impossible to do
good work yourself if you're too far removed from one
of these centers.</span>  <span class="s s322">You can push or pull these trends
to some extent, but you can't break away from them.</span><span class="s s323">

than to imagine beauty.</span>  <span class="s s339">Most of the people who've made beautiful
things seem to have done it by fixing something that they    
thought ugly.</span><span class="s s340">  Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees
something and thinks,
