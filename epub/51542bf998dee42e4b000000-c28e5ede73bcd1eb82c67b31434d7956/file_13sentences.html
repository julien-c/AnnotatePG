  <h2><span class="s s1">Startups in 13 Sentences</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
February 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned
from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy
than to make a lot of people semi-happy.</span> <span class="s s4">I was saying recently to
a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would
be one of them.</span> <span class="s s5">Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">When I made the list there turned out to be 13:
</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">
1. Pick good cofounders.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.</span> <span class="s s9">You
can change anything about a house except where it is.</span> <span class="s s10">In a startup
you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is
hard.</span> 
<span class="s s11">[1]
And the success of a startup is almost always a function
of its founders.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">2. Launch fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get
your product to market early, but that you haven't really started
working on it till you've launched.</span> <span class="s s14">Launching teaches you what you
should have been building.</span> <span class="s s15">Till you know that you're wasting your
time.</span> <span class="s s16">So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext
for engaging users.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">3. Let your idea evolve.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">This is the second half of launching fast.</span> <span class="s s19">Launch fast and iterate.</span>
<span class="s s20">It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter
of implementing some brilliant initial idea.</span> <span class="s s21">As in an essay, most
of the ideas appear in the implementing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">4. Understand your users.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,
where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you
improve their lives.</span>
<span class="s s24">[2]
The second dimension is the one you have
most control over.</span> <span class="s s25">And indeed, the growth in the first will be
driven by how well you do in the second.</span> <span class="s s26">As in science, the hard
part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is
seeing something new that users lack.</span> <span class="s s27">The better you understand
them the better the odds of doing that.</span> <span class="s s28">That's why so many successful
startups make something the founders needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you
can't expect to hit that right away.</span> <span class="s s31">Initially you have to choose
between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,
or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.</span> <span class="s s32">Take
the first.</span> <span class="s s33">It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.</span>
<span class="s s34">And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.</span> <span class="s s35">If
you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know
it's not 70%?</span> <span class="s s36">Or 10%?</span> <span class="s s37">Whereas it's easy to know how many users
you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s38">6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">Customers are used to being maltreated.</span> <span class="s s40">Most of the companies they
deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer
service.</span> <span class="s s41">Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously
lowered by such experiences.</span> <span class="s s42">Try making your customer service not
merely good, but 
surprisingly good.</span> <span class="s s43">Go out of your way to make
people happy.</span> <span class="s s44">They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see.</span> <span class="s s45">In the earliest
stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level
that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your
users.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">7. You make what you measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">I learned this one from Joe Kraus.</span> 
<span class="s s48">[3]
Merely measuring something
has an uncanny tendency to improve it.</span> <span class="s s49">If you want to make your
user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every
day plot the number of users.</span> <span class="s s50">You'll be delighted when it goes up
and disappointed when it goes down.</span> <span class="s s51">Pretty soon you'll start
noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more
of that.</span> <span class="s s52">Corollary: be careful what you measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">8. Spend little.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.</span>
<span class="s s55">Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the
most common form of failure is running out of money.</span> <span class="s s56">So being cheap
is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.</span>
<span class="s s57">[4]
But it's
more than that.</span> <span class="s s58">A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in
something like the way exercise keeps people young.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">9. Get ramen profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">"Ramen profitable" means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.</span> <span class="s s61">It's not rapid prototyping for business
models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment
process.</span> <span class="s s62">Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely
changes your relationship with investors.</span> <span class="s s63">It's also great for
morale.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">10. Avoid distractions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">Nothing kills startups like distractions.</span> <span class="s s66">The worst type are those
that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.</span>
<span class="s s67">The startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always
interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now.</span>
<span class="s s68">Paradoxically, fundraising is this type of distraction, so try to
minimize that too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">11. Don't get demoralized.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running
out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.</span> <span class="s s71">Either
the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with
advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.</span> <span class="s s72">Starting a
startup is a huge moral weight.</span> <span class="s s73">Understand this and make a conscious
effort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to
bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">12. Don't give up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">Even if you get demoralized, don't give up.</span> <span class="s s76">You can get surprisingly
far by just not giving up.</span> <span class="s s77">This isn't true in all fields.</span> <span class="s s78">There
are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no
matter how long they persisted.</span> <span class="s s79">But startups aren't like that.</span>
<span class="s s80">Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your
idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">13. Deals fall through.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting
our hopes up.</span> <span class="s s83">We probably had 20 deals of various types fall
through.</span> <span class="s s84">After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as
background processes that we should ignore till they terminated.</span>
<span class="s s85">It's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing,
not just because they so often don't, but because it makes them
less likely to.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s87">
Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd
choose if I could only keep one.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">Understand your users.</span> <span class="s s89">That's the key.</span> <span class="s s90">The essential task in a
startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most
control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest
part of that is knowing what to make for them.</span> <span class="s s91">Once you know what
to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are
capable of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this
list.</span> <span class="s s93">That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users.</span>
<span class="s s94">Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users.</span>
<span class="s s95">Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making
something that makes a few people deeply happy.</span> <span class="s s96">The most important
reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it
helps you understand your users.</span> <span class="s s97">And understanding your users will
even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing
around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">[1]
Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s100">[2]
In practice it's more like a ragged comb.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s101">[3]
Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first,
but he doesn't remember which.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s102">[4]
They'd be interchangeable if markets stood still. Since they
don't, working twice as fast is better than having twice as much
time.</span></p>
