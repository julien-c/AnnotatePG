<p><span class="s s2">August 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a talk at Defcon 2005.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality.</span> <span class="s s5">There are
two ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the 
rich.</span> <span class="s s6">But they amount to the same thing, because if you want to
give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere.</span> <span class="s s7">You
can't get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started.</span>
<span class="s s8">You have to get it from the rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply
shifting money from the rich.</span> <span class="s s10">You could help the poor become more
productive-- for example, by improving access to education.</span> <span class="s s11">Instead
of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,
you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to
become engineers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer.</span> <span class="s s13">But the
evidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn't reduce economic
inequality, because it makes the rich richer too.</span> <span class="s s14">If there
are more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them
and to sell them things.</span> <span class="s s15">Henry Ford couldn't have made a fortune 
building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence
farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving
the overall standard of living, it's not enough just to raise up 
the poor.</span> <span class="s s17">What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious
and goes on to become another Bill Gates?</span> <span class="s s18">Economic inequality will
be as bad as ever.</span> <span class="s s19">If you actually want to compress the gap between
rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing
up on the bottom.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">How do you push down on the top?</span> <span class="s s21">You could try to decrease the
productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best 
surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to
overeat, and so on.</span> <span class="s s22">But this approach is hard to implement.</span> <span class="s s23">The
only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,
and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)
to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">So let's be clear what reducing economic inequality means. It is 
identical with taking money from the rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you
often notice new things.</span> <span class="s s26">So it is in this case.</span> <span class="s s27">Taking money from
the rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when
one phrases the same idea in terms of "reducing inequality.</span><span class="s s28">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate.</span> <span class="s s30">A bet 
with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a
50% chance of winning, or no one will take it.</span> <span class="s s31">So if you lop off
the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people's
willingness to take risks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic
inequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking 
if the maximum return is decreased.</span> <span class="s s34">One reason high tax rates are
disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new
companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">Investors</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">Startups are intrinsically risky.</span> <span class="s s37">A startup
is like a small boat
in the open sea.</span> <span class="s s38">One big wave and you're sunk.</span> <span class="s s39">A competing product,
a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory
approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure
of a key employee, the loss of a big account---any one of these can
destroy you overnight.</span> <span class="s s40">It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds.</span>
<span class="s s41">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x.</span> <span class="s s43">Which 
meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in
us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding.</span> <span class="s s44">That 
sounds about right.</span> <span class="s s45">That's probably roughly how we looked when we
were a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out
of an apartment.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">If that kind of risk doesn't pay, venture investing, as we know it,
doesn't happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new
companies.</span> <span class="s s48">Why not just have the government, or some large
almost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the venture
investing instead of private funds?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">I'll tell you why that wouldn't work.</span> <span class="s s50">Because then you're asking
government or almost-government employees to do the one thing they 
are least able to do: take risks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important
thing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that
can be justified later if they fail.</span> <span class="s s52">If there is a safe option,
that's the one a bureaucrat will choose.</span> <span class="s s53">But that is exactly the 
wrong way to do venture investing.</span> <span class="s s54">The nature of the business means
that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks
good enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">VCs are currently 
paid in a way that makes them 
focus on the upside:
they get a percentage of the fund's gains.</span> <span class="s s56">And that helps overcome
their understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerds
who look like (and perhaps are) college students.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">If VCs weren't allowed to get rich, they'd behave like bureaucrats.</span>
<span class="s s58">Without hope of gain, they'd have only fear of loss.</span> <span class="s s59">And so they'd
make the wrong choices.</span> <span class="s s60">They'd turn down the nerds in favor of the
smooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be
easier to justify later if it failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Founders</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work
without allowing VCs to become rich, there's another kind of investor
you simply cannot replace: the startups' founders and early employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">What they invest is their time and ideas.</span> <span class="s s64">But these are equivalent
to money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) to
treat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to "sweat 
equity" and the equity they've purchased with cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">The fact that you're investing time doesn't change the relationship
between risk and reward.</span> <span class="s s66">If you're going to invest your time in
something with a small chance of succeeding, you'll only do it if
there is a proportionately large payoff.</span>
<span class="s s67">[2]
If large payoffs aren't allowed, you may as well play it safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich.</span> <span class="s s69">But not because 
I wanted to buy expensive things.</span> <span class="s s70">What I wanted was security.</span> <span class="s s71">I 
wanted to make enough money that I didn't have to worry about money.</span>
<span class="s s72">If I'd been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I
would have sought security by some other means: for example, by
going to work for a big, stable organization from which it would
be hard to get fired.</span> <span class="s s73">Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I 
would have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research 
lab, or tenure at a university.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">That's what everyone does in societies where risk isn't rewarded.</span>
<span class="s s75">If you can't ensure your own security, the next best thing is to
make a nest for yourself in some large organization where your
status depends mostly on seniority.</span>
<span class="s s76">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don't see how we could
replace founders.</span> <span class="s s78">Investors mainly contribute money, which in
principle is the same no matter what the source.</span> <span class="s s79">But the founders
contribute ideas.</span> <span class="s s80">You can't replace those.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">Let's rehearse the chain of argument so far.</span> <span class="s s82">I'm heading for a 
conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking 
and screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable.</span> <span class="s s83">Decreasing
economic inequality means taking money from the rich.</span> <span class="s s84">Since risk
and reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically
decreases people's appetite for risk.</span> <span class="s s85">Startups are intrinsically
risky.</span> <span class="s s86">Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk,
founders will not invest their time in a startup.</span> <span class="s s87">Founders are
irreplaceable.</span> <span class="s s88">So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating
startups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups.</span>
<span class="s s90">It's the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water 
drives a water mill.</span> <span class="s s91">People start startups in the hope of becoming
much richer than they were before.</span> <span class="s s92">And if your society tries to
prevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will
also prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">Growth</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">This argument applies proportionately.</span> <span class="s s95">It's not just that if you 
eliminate economic inequality, you get no startups.</span> <span class="s s96">To the extent 
you reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of startups.</span>
<span class="s s97">[4]
Increase taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases in
proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">And that seems bad for everyone.</span> <span class="s s99">New technology and new jobs both
come disproportionately from new companies.</span> <span class="s s100">Indeed, if you don't
have startups, pretty soon you won't have established companies
either, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won't
have any adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s101">It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality.</span> 
<span class="s s102">When you phrase it that way, who can argue with you?</span> <span class="s s103">Inequality
has to be bad, right?</span> <span class="s s104">It sounds a good deal less benevolent to say
we ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded.</span>
<span class="s s105">And yet the one implies the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">Indeed, it may be that reducing investors' appetite for risk doesn't
merely kill off larval startups, but kills off the most promising
ones especially.</span> <span class="s s107">Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than
established companies.</span> <span class="s s108">Does this trend also hold among startups?</span>
<span class="s s109">That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate most
growth if they succeed?</span> <span class="s s110">I suspect the answer is yes.</span> <span class="s s111">And that's 
a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors'
appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to 
go.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course.</span> <span class="s s113">What
if we let people get rich by starting startups, but taxed away all
other surplus wealth?</span> <span class="s s114">Wouldn't that at least decrease inequality?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s115">Less than you might think.</span> <span class="s s116">If you made it so that people could
only get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get rich
would all start startups.</span> <span class="s s117">And that might be a great thing.</span> <span class="s s118">But I
don't think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth.</span>
<span class="s s119">People who want to get rich will do whatever they have to.</span> <span class="s s120">If
startups are the only way to do it, you'll just get far more people
starting startups.</span> <span class="s s121">(If you write the laws very carefully, that is.</span>
<span class="s s122">More likely, you'll just get a lot of people doing things that can
be made to look on paper like startups.</span><span class="s s123">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s124">If we're determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is still
one way out: we could say that we're willing to go ahead and do
without startups.</span> <span class="s s125">What would happen if we did?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">At a minimum, we'd have to accept lower rates of technological 
growth.</span> <span class="s s127">If you believe that large, established companies could 
somehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, the
ball is in your court to explain how.</span> <span class="s s128">(If you can come up with a 
remotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing business
books and consulting for large companies.</span><span class="s s129">)
[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s130">Ok, so we get slower growth.</span> <span class="s s131">Is that so bad?</span> <span class="s s132">Well, one reason
it's bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to
slow down with us.</span> <span class="s s133">If you're content to develop new technologies
at a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that
you don't invent anything at all.</span> <span class="s s134">Anything you might discover has
already been invented elsewhere.</span> <span class="s s135">And the only thing you can offer 
in return is raw materials and cheap labor.</span> <span class="s s136">Once you sink that
low, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install
puppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women
as prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory-- all the
things we do to poor countries now.</span> <span class="s s137">The only defense is to isolate
yourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century.</span> <span class="s s138">But
the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce 
it.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s140">Wealth and Power</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">I realize startups are not the main target of those who want to
eliminate economic inequality.</span> <span class="s s142">What they really dislike is the
sort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliance
with power.</span> <span class="s s143">For example, construction firms that fund politicians'
campaigns in return for government contracts, or rich parents who 
get their children into good colleges by sending them to expensive
schools designed for that purpose.</span> <span class="s s144">But if you try to attack this type of wealth
through economic policy, it's hard to hit without destroying
startups as collateral damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">The problem here is not wealth, but corruption. So why not go after
corruption?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s146">We don't need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent
wealth from translating into power.</span> <span class="s s147">And there has been progress
on that front.</span> <span class="s s148">Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt's
wastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate 
occasions, killing two of them.</span> <span class="s s149">By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove 
off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to 
one.</span> <span class="s s150">Today it may well be zero.</span> <span class="s s151">But what's changed is not variation
in wealth.</span> <span class="s s152">What's changed is the ability to translate wealth into
power.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">How do you break the connection between wealth and power?</span> <span class="s s154">Demand 
transparency.</span> <span class="s s155">Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an
account of how decisions are made.</span> <span class="s s156">Why aren't all police interrogations
videotaped?</span> <span class="s s157">Why did 36% of Princeton's class of 2007 come from
prep schools, when only 1.</span><span class="s s158">7% of American kids attend them?</span> <span class="s s159">Why did
the US really invade Iraq?</span> <span class="s s160">Why don't government officials disclose
more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says the
single most important step is to log everything.</span> <span class="s s162">Back when he was
a kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was the
idea of leaving a trail.</span> <span class="s s163">He was more inconvenienced by the need 
to avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s164">Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and 
power flourishes in secret.</span> <span class="s s165">Expose all transactions, and you will
greatly reduce it.</span> <span class="s s166">Log everything.</span> <span class="s s167">That's a strategy that already
seems to be working, and it doesn't have the side effect of making
your whole country poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s168">I don't think many people realize there is a connection between
economic inequality and risk.</span> <span class="s s169">I didn't fully grasp it till recently.</span>
<span class="s s170">I'd known for years of course that if one didn't score in a startup,
the other alternative was to get a cozy, tenured research job.</span> <span class="s s171">But
I didn't understand the equation governing my behavior.</span> <span class="s s172">Likewise, 
it's obvious empirically that a country that doesn't let people get
rich is headed for disaster, whether it's Diocletian's Rome or 
Harold Wilson's Britain.</span> <span class="s s173">But I did not till recently understand
the role risk played.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and 
with it growth.</span> <span class="s s175">If we want a fairer world, I think we're better 
off attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s176">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s177">[1]
Success here is defined from the initial investors' point of
view: either an IPO, or an acquisition for more than the valuation
at the last round of funding.</span> <span class="s s178">The conventional 1 in 10 success rate
is suspiciously neat, but conversations with VCs suggest it's roughly
correct for startups overall.</span> <span class="s s179">Top VC firms expect to do better.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">[2]
I'm not claiming founders sit down and calculate the expected 
after-tax return from a startup.</span> <span class="s s181">They're motivated by examples of
other people who did it.</span> <span class="s s182">And those examples do reflect after-tax returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s183">[3]
Conjecture: The variation in wealth in a (non-corrupt) 
country or organization
will be inversely proportional to the prevalence of systems of
seniority.</span> <span class="s s184">So if you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will
become correspondingly more important.</span> <span class="s s185">So far, I know of no
counterexamples, though in very corrupt countries you may get 
both simultaneously.</span> <span class="s s186">(Thanks to Daniel Sobral for pointing
this out.</span><span class="s s187">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s188">[4]
In a country with a truly feudal economy, you might be able to
redistribute wealth successfully, because there are no startups to
kill.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">[5]
The speed at which startups develop new techology is the other 
reason they pay so well.</span> <span class="s s190">As I explained in "How to Make Wealth" 
(in Hackers
&amp; Painters), what you do in a startup is compress a
lifetime's worth of work into a few years.</span> <span class="s s191">It seems as
dumb to discourage that as to discourage risk-taking.</span></p>
