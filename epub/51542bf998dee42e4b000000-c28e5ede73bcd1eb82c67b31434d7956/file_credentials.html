  <h2><span class="s s1">After Credentials</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">December 2008</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">A few months ago I read a New York Times article on South
Korean cram schools that said </span></p><span class="s s4">&nbsp;
 Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious
 young South Korean.
&nbsp; A parent added: &nbsp;
 "In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent
 of a person's future."
&nbsp; It was striking how old fashioned this sounded. And
yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off
as a description of the US. Which means things must have been
changing here.</span><p><span class="s s5">The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined
less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years
ago.</span> <span class="s s6">Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used
to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">What happened?</span></p><span class="s s8">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s9">Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an
advance.</span> <span class="s s10">The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting
in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an
exam on classical literature.</span> <span class="s s11">[1] It was also a test of wealth,
because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing
required years of expensive training.</span> <span class="s s12">But though wealth was a
necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.</span> <span class="s s13">By
the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system
was very enlightened.</span> <span class="s s14">Europeans didn't introduce formal civil
service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem
to have been influenced by the Chinese example.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by
family influence, if not outright bribery.</span> <span class="s s16">It was a great step
forward to judge people by their performance on a test.</span> <span class="s s17">But by no
means a perfect solution.</span> <span class="s s18">When you judge people that way, you tend
to get cram schools&mdash;which they did in Ming China and nineteenth
century England just as much as in present day South Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.</span> <span class="s s20">The use of
credentials
was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between
generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes
in the seal.</span> <span class="s s21">Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into
credentials in the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit
whatever the tests measure.</span> <span class="s s23">When the tests are narrow and
predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those
that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or
the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.</span>
<span class="s s24">But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.</span> <span class="s s25">Preparing a
candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,
as prep school does today.</span> <span class="s s26">But the raison d'etre of all these
institutions has been the same: to beat the system.</span> <span class="s s27">[2]</span></p><span class="s s28">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s29">History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society
prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from
influencing their children's success directly.</span> <span class="s s30">It's a fine thing
for parents to help their children indirectly&mdash;for example,
by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then
makes them more successful.</span> <span class="s s31">The problem comes when parents use
direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power
as a substitute for their children's qualities.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Parents will tend to do this when they can.</span> <span class="s s33">Parents will die for
their kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their
scruples to the limits for them.</span> <span class="s s34">Especially if other parents are
doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">Sealing off this force has a double advantage.</span> <span class="s s36">Not only does a
society get "the best man for the job," but
parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect
ones&mdash;to actually trying to raise their kids well.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts
to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.</span> <span class="s s38">We're dealing with
one of most powerful forces in human nature.</span> <span class="s s39">We shouldn't expect
naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions
for keeping heroin out of a prison to work.</span></p><span class="s s40">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s41">The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.</span>
<span class="s s42">If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study
the way people beat them and try to plug the holes.</span> <span class="s s43">You can use
the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.</span> <span class="s s44">They
also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram
schools become less popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">A more general solution
would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical
social bottlenecks like college admissions.</span> <span class="s s46">In the US this process
still shows many outward signs of corruption.</span> <span class="s s47">For example, legacy
admissions.</span> <span class="s s48">The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry
much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are
bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between
the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.</span> <span class="s s49">But what
this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much
or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the
bucket that straddles the cutoff.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could
probably make them more airtight.</span> <span class="s s51">But what a long fight it would
be.</span> <span class="s s52">Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't
really want them to be airtight.</span></p><span class="s s53">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s54">Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission
of power between generations.</span> <span class="s s55">Instead of trying to make credentials
harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">Let's think about what credentials are for.</span> <span class="s s57">What they are,
functionally, is a way of predicting performance.</span> <span class="s s58">If you could
measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">So why did they even evolve?</span> <span class="s s60">Why haven't we just been measuring
actual performance?</span> <span class="s s61">Think about where credentialism first appeared:
in selecting candidates for large organizations.</span> <span class="s s62">Individual
performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the
harder performance is to measure, the more important it is
to predict it.</span> <span class="s s63">If an organization could immediately and cheaply
measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine
their credentials.</span> <span class="s s64">They could take everyone and keep just the good
ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">Large organizations can't do this.</span> <span class="s s66">But a bunch of small organizations
in a market can come close.</span> <span class="s s67">A market takes every organization and
keeps just the good ones.</span> <span class="s s68">As organizations get smaller, this
approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.</span> <span class="s s69">So
all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller
organizations will care less about credentials.</span></p><span class="s s70">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s71">That's what's been happening in the US.</span> <span class="s s72">That's why those quotes
from Korea sound so old fashioned.</span> <span class="s s73">They're talking about an economy
like America's a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.</span>
<span class="s s74">The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join
one and climb to the top.</span> <span class="s s75">Credentials matter a lot then.</span> <span class="s s76">In the 
culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">This doesn't work in small companies.</span> <span class="s s78">Even if your colleagues were
impressed by your credentials, they'd soon be parted from you if
your performance didn't match, because the company would go out of
business and the people would be dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares
about.</span> <span class="s s80">People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even
graduated from college, let alone which one.</span> <span class="s s81">All they care about
is what you can do.</span> <span class="s s82">Which is in fact all that should matter, even
in a large organization.</span> <span class="s s83">The reason credentials have such prestige
is that for so long the large organizations
in a society tended to be the most powerful.</span> <span class="s s84">But in the US at least
they don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely
because they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance.</span>
<span class="s s85">Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can
get rewarded directly by the market?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most
other people.</span> <span class="s s87">As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,
I'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of
credentials and into the new one of performance.</span> <span class="s s88">I'm an agent of
the change I'm seeing.</span> <span class="s s89">But I don't think I'm imagining it.</span> <span class="s s90">It was
not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be
judged directly by the market.</span> <span class="s s91">You had to go through bosses, and
they were influenced by where you'd been to college.</span></p><span class="s s92">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s93">What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?</span>
<span class="s s94">I'm still not entirely sure.</span> <span class="s s95">Startups are certainly a large part
of it.</span> <span class="s s96">Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large
ones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">But I don't think startups account for all the shift from credentials
to measurement.</span> <span class="s s98">My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went
to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates
far less than firms do today.</span> <span class="s s99">Law firms then made no pretense of
paying people according to the value of the work they'd done.</span> <span class="s s100">Pay
was based on seniority.</span> <span class="s s101">The younger employees were paying their
dues.</span> <span class="s s102">They'd be rewarded later.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.</span> <span class="s s104">When my
father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people
working for him who made more than he did, because they'd been there
longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s105">Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for
the work they do.</span> <span class="s s106">One reason is that employees no longer trust
companies to deliver 
deferred rewards: why work to accumulate
deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken
over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?</span> <span class="s s107">The other
is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees
large amounts.</span> <span class="s s108">This was particularly true in consulting, law, and
finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.</span> <span class="s s109">The word is
rarely used today because it's no longer surprising to see a 25
year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old
professional able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it
called forth a new word.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.</span> <span class="s s111">He didn't work
for General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General
Widget's acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their
bond issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary
roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</span> <span class="s s113">I don't
think there was a causal connection.</span> <span class="s s114">Startups happened because
technology started to change so fast that big companies could no
longer keep a lid on the smaller ones.</span> <span class="s s115">I don't think the rise of
yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change
in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way
big companies worked.</span> <span class="s s116">But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce
a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people
market rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from
them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums
that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.</span> <span class="s s118">Was there a connection?</span>
<span class="s s119">I don't know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.</span> <span class="s s120">There
was a lot of energy released.</span></p><span class="s s121">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s122">Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be
concerned about the number of startups started within them.</span> <span class="s s123">But
they would do even better to examine the underlying principle.</span> <span class="s s124">Do
they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work
they do?</span> <span class="s s125">The young are the test, because when people aren't rewarded
according to performance, they're invariably rewarded according to
seniority instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for
performance.</span> <span class="s s127">Measurement spreads like heat.</span> <span class="s s128">If one part of a
society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the
others to do better.</span> <span class="s s129">If people who are young but smart and driven
can make more by starting their own companies than by working for
existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to
keep them.</span> <span class="s s130">So market rates gradually permeate every organization,
even the government.</span> <span class="s s131">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations
issuing credentials into line.</span> <span class="s s133">When we were kids I used to annoy
my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do
anyway.</span> <span class="s s134">As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar
role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.</span> <span class="s s135">Once credential
granting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecy
business, they'll have to work harder to predict the future.</span></p><span class="s s136">&nbsp;_____&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s137">Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.</span> <span class="s s138">But they're
not the final step.</span> <span class="s s139">There's an even better way to block the
transmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend
toward an economy made of more, smaller units.</span> <span class="s s140">Then you can measure
what credentials merely predict.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">No one likes the transmission of power between generations&mdash;not
the left or the right.</span> <span class="s s142">But the market forces favored by the right
turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials
the left are forced to fall back on.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s143">The era of credentials began to end when the power of large
organizations peaked 
in the late twentieth century.</span> <span class="s s144">Now we seem
to be entering a new era based on measurement.</span> <span class="s s145">The reason the new
model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.</span> <span class="s s146">It
shows no sign of slowing.</span></p>
