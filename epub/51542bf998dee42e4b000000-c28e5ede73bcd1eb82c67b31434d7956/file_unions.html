<p><span class="s s2">May 2007</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor
generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.</span>
<span class="s s4">In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing
jobs that boosted the median income.</span> <span class="s s5">I wouldn't quite call the
high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it
are reading too much into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize
where the high-paying union job came from.</span> <span class="s s7">In a rapidly growing
market, you don't worry too much about efficiency.</span> <span class="s s8">It's more
important to grow fast.</span> <span class="s s9">If there's some mundane problem getting
in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive,
just take it and get on with more important things.</span> <span class="s s10">EBay didn't
win by paying less for servers than their competitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a
growth industry in the mid twentieth century.</span> <span class="s s12">This was an era when
small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting
consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and
huge economies of scale.</span> <span class="s s13">You had to grow fast or die.</span> <span class="s s14">Workers
were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.</span>
<span class="s s15">A reliable supply was more important than low cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude
must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as
the new model isn't delayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was
worth.</span> <span class="s s18">Circumstances being what they were, companies would have
been stupid to insist on paying them so little.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask
anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the
Internet Bubble.</span> <span class="s s20">In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums
of money for building the most trivial things.</span> <span class="s s21">And yet does anyone
who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?</span> <span class="s s22">I
doubt it.</span> <span class="s s23">Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary
aberration.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration, 
just spread
over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology
that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they
would something like consulting during the Bubble.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Basically, unions were just Razorfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union
organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now?</span>
<span class="s s27">The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of
people living in fallen civilizations.</span> <span class="s s28">Our ancestors were giants.</span>
<span class="s s29">The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral
courage that's lacking today.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">In fact there's a simpler explanation.</span> <span class="s s31">The early twentieth century
was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure.</span> <span class="s s32">And
we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned
whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying
union job.</span> <span class="s s33">We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies
overspend on different things.</span></p>
