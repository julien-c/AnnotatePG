  <h2><span class="s s1">Five Founders</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">April 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Inc recently asked me who I thought were the 5 most
interesting startup founders of the last 30 years.</span> <span class="s s4">How do
you decide who's the most interesting?</span> <span class="s s5">The best test seemed
to be influence: who are the 5
who've influenced me most?</span> <span class="s s6">Who do I use as examples when I'm
talking to companies we fund?</span> <span class="s s7">Who do I find myself quoting?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">1. Steve Jobs</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">I'd guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but
for most people you could ask.</span> <span class="s s10">A lot of startup culture is Apple
culture.</span> <span class="s s11">He was the original young founder.</span> <span class="s s12">And while the concept
of "insanely great" already existed in the arts, it was a novel
idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">More remarkable still, he's stayed interesting for 30 years.</span> <span class="s s14">People
await new Apple products the way they'd await new books by a popular
novelist.</span> <span class="s s15">Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn't
happen if he weren't CEO.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.</span>
<span class="s s17">What makes him unique is his 
sense of 
design.</span> <span class="s s18">Before him, most
companies treated design as a frivolous extra.</span> <span class="s s19">Apple's competitors
now know better.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">2. TJ Rodgers</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">TJ Rodgers isn't as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the best
writer among Silicon Valley CEOs.</span> <span class="s s22">I've probably learned more from
him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else.</span> <span class="s s23">Not
so much from specific things he's written as by reconstructing the
mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collecting
outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I
remember exactly where I was at the time.</span> <span class="s s25">It was 
High
Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?</span> <span class="s s26">and
I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.</span> <span class="s s27">It felt as if
someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">3. Larry &amp; Sergey</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">I'm sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person.</span> <span class="s s30">I've always
thought that was unfair to them.</span> <span class="s s31">But it does seem as if Google was a
collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it was
important to have the best hackers.</span> <span class="s s33">So they claimed, at least.</span>
<span class="s s34">But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before.</span> <span class="s s35">Their
hypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial stages at least,
all you need is good hackers: if you hire all the smartest people
and put them to work on a problem where their success can be measured,
you win.</span> <span class="s s36">All the other stuff&mdash;which includes all the stuff that
business schools think business consists of&mdash;you can figure out
along the way.</span> <span class="s s37">The results won't be perfect, but they'll be optimal.</span>
<span class="s s38">If this was their hypothesis, it's now been verified experimentally.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">4. Paul Buchheit</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">Few know this, but one person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible for
three of the best things Google has done.</span> <span class="s s41">He was the original
author of GMail, which is the most impressive thing Google has after
search.</span> <span class="s s42">He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense, and was the
author of Google's mantra "Don't be evil.</span><span class="s s43">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startup
we fund: that it's better, initially, to make a small number of
users really love you than a large number kind of like you.</span> <span class="s s45">If I
could tell startups only 
ten sentences, 
this would be one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">Now he's cofounder of a startup called Friendfeed.</span> <span class="s s47">It's only a
year old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching them.</span>
<span class="s s48">Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at Google is
going to come up with more.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">5. Sam Altman</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">I was told I shouldn't mention founders of YC-funded companies in
this list.</span> <span class="s s51">But Sam Altman can't be stopped by such flimsy rules.</span>
<span class="s s52">If he wants to be on this list, he's going to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to
most when I'm advising startups.</span> <span class="s s54">On questions of design, I ask
"What would Steve do?</span><span class="s s55">"</span> <span class="s s56">but on questions of strategy or ambition I
ask "What would Sama do?</span><span class="s s57">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect
applies to startups.</span> <span class="s s59">It applies way less than most people think:
startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the
way you might in a horse race.</span> <span class="s s60">But there are a few people with
such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want.</span></p>
