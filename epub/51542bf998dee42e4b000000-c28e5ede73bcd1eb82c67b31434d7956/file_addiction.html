  <h2><span class="s s1">The Acceleration of Addictiveness</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">July 2010</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is
that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.</span>
<span class="s s4">Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.</span> <span class="s s5">And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">We wouldn't want to stop it.</span> <span class="s s7">It's the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress.</span> <span class="s s8">Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want.</span> <span class="s s9">When the thing we want is
something we want to want, we consider technological progress good.</span>
<span class="s s10">If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that
seems strictly better.</span> <span class="s s11">When progress concentrates something we
don't want to want&mdash;when it transforms opium into heroin&mdash;it seems
bad.</span> <span class="s s12">But it's the same process at work.</span>
<span class="s s13">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing
numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like
too much.</span>
<span class="s s15">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.</span>
<span class="s s17">The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive.</span><span class="s s18">"</span> <span class="s s19">That usage has
become increasingly common during my lifetime.</span> <span class="s s20">And it's clear why:
there are an increasing number of things we need it for.</span> <span class="s s21">At the
extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth.</span> <span class="s s22">Food has been
transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in
food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the
buck, and you can see the results in any town in America.</span> <span class="s s23">Checkers
and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.</span>
<span class="s s24">TV has become much more engaging, and even so it can't compete with Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.</span> <span class="s s26">And unless
the forms of technological progress that produced these things are
subject to different laws than technological progress in general,
the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did
in the last 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.</span> <span class="s s28">I don't
mean to imply they're all to be avoided.</span> <span class="s s29">Alcohol is a dangerous
drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.</span>
<span class="s s30">Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.</span>
<span class="s s31">More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful
about.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Most people won't, unfortunately.</span> <span class="s s33">Which means that as the world
becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a
normal life will be driven ever further apart.</span> <span class="s s34">One sense of "normal"
is statistically normal: what everyone else does.</span> <span class="s s35">The other is the
sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a
piece of machinery: what works best.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">These two senses are already quite far apart.</span> <span class="s s37">Already someone
trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of
the US.</span> <span class="s s38">That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.</span>
<span class="s s39">You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if
people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.</span>
<span class="s s41">I've seen that happen with cigarettes.</span> <span class="s s42">When cigarettes first
appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through
a previously isolated population.</span> <span class="s s43">Smoking rapidly became a
(statistically) normal thing.</span> <span class="s s44">There were ashtrays everywhere.</span> <span class="s s45">We
had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of
my parents smoked.</span> <span class="s s46">You had to for guests.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.</span>
<span class="s s48">In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something
that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something
movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of
addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.</span> <span class="s s49">A lot of the
change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation
couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">It took a while though&mdash;on the order of 100 years.</span> <span class="s s51">And unless the
rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the
accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new
addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to
protect us.</span>
<span class="s s52">[3]
Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine
of each new addiction&mdash;the people whose sad example becomes a
lesson to future generations&mdash;we'll have to figure out for ourselves
what to avoid and how.</span> <span class="s s53">It will actually become a reasonable strategy
(or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect 
everything new.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">In fact, even that won't be enough.</span> <span class="s s55">We'll have to worry not just
about new things, but also about existing things becoming more
addictive.</span> <span class="s s56">That's what bit me.</span> <span class="s s57">I've avoided most addictions, but
the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using
it.</span>
<span class="s s58">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.</span> <span class="s s60">We're
all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.</span>
<span class="s s61">That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I
want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.</span>
<span class="s s62">[5]
My latest trick is taking long hikes.</span> <span class="s s63">I used to think running was a
better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.</span> <span class="s s64">Now
the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I
spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it?</span> <span class="s s66">It always will when you're
trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide
you.</span> <span class="s s67">Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric.</span>
<span class="s s68">But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this
kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate
of anyone who wants to get things done.</span> <span class="s s69">We'll increasingly be
defined by what we say no to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">[1]
Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you
wanted it?</span> <span class="s s72">Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.</span>
<span class="s s73">And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects.</span>
<span class="s s74">"Good" and "bad" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated,
so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the
former.</span> <span class="s s75">And in any case, as Prohibition and the "war on drugs"
show, bans often do more harm than good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">[2]
Technology has always been accelerating. By Paleolithic
standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic
period.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">[3]
Unless we mass produce social customs. I suspect the recent
resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction
to drugs.</span> <span class="s s78">In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if
their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to God.</span> <span class="s s79">But
that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to
say no to drugs.</span> <span class="s s80">You end up saying no to 
science as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people
plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books
a package tour.</span> <span class="s s82">Or worse still, has one booked for them by the
government.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">[4]
People commonly use the word "procrastination" to describe
what they do on the Internet.</span> <span class="s s84">It seems to me too mild to describe
what's happening as merely not-doing-work.</span> <span class="s s85">We don't call it
procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">[5]
Several people have told me they like the iPad because it
lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would
be too conspicuous.</span> <span class="s s87">In other words, it's a hip flask.</span> <span class="s s88">(This is
true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as
obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.</span><span class="s s89">)</span></p>
