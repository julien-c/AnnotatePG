<p><span class="s s2">
October 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2005 
Startup School.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">How do you get good ideas for 
startups? That's probably the number
one question people ask me.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">I'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's
hard to come up with ideas for startups?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">That might seem a stupid thing to ask. Why do they think
it's hard? If people can't do it, then it is hard, at least
for them. Right?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">Well, maybe not.</span> <span class="s s8">What people usually say is not that they can't
think of ideas, but that they don't have any.</span> <span class="s s9">That's not quite the
same thing.</span> <span class="s s10">It could be the reason they don't have any is that
they haven't tried to generate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">I think this is often the case.</span> <span class="s s12">I think people believe that coming
up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it must be
very hard-- and so they don't try do to it.</span> <span class="s s13">They assume ideas are
like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">I also have a theory about why people think this.</span> <span class="s s15">They overvalue
ideas.</span> <span class="s s16">They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementing
some fabulous initial idea.</span> <span class="s s17">And since a successful startup is worth
millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a
million dollar idea, then of course it's going to seem hard.</span> <span class="s s19">Too
hard to bother trying.</span> <span class="s s20">Our instincts tell us something so valuable
would not be just lying around for anyone to discover.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here's
an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one.</span> <span class="s s22">Nothing
evolves faster than markets.</span> <span class="s s23">The fact that there's no market for
startup ideas suggests there's no demand.</span> <span class="s s24">Which means, in the
narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea.</span>
<span class="s s27">It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial
idea is that, in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll
come up with your real idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a
question.</span> <span class="s s29">It might help if they were expressed that way.</span> <span class="s s30">Instead
of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet?</span> <span class="s s31">A few grammatical tweaks, and a woefully incomplete
idea becomes a promising question to explore.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">There's a real difference, because an assertion provokes objections
in a way a question doesn't.</span> <span class="s s33">If you say: I'm going to build a
web-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most dangerous of which
are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you'd be competing
with Microsoft, that you couldn't give people the kind of UI they
expect, that users wouldn't want to have their data on your servers,
and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">A question doesn't seem so challenging.</span> <span class="s s35">It becomes: let's try
making a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get.</span> <span class="s s36">And everyone
knows that if you tried this you'd be able to make something
useful.</span> <span class="s s37">Maybe what you'd end up with wouldn't even be a spreadsheet.</span>
<span class="s s38">Maybe it would be some kind of new spreasheet-like collaboration
tool that doesn't even have a name yet.</span> <span class="s s39">You wouldn't have thought
of something like that except by implementing your way toward it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking
for.</span> <span class="s s41">If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right.</span> <span class="s s42">But if it's
a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that
leads to more ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial
solution.</span> <span class="s s44">When someone's working on a problem that seems too
big, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some subset of the
problem, then gradually expand from there?</span> <span class="s s45">That will generally
work unless you get trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-style
AI, or C.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">Upwind</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">So far, we've reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollar
idea to thinking of a mistaken question.</span> <span class="s s48">That doesn't seem so hard,
does it?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with 
promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends.</span>
<span class="s s50">New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and
conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">Universities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out
of them.</span> <span class="s s52">They're filled with new technologies, because they're
trying to produce research, and only things that are new count as
research.</span> <span class="s s53">And they're full of exactly the right kind of people to 
have ideas with: the other students, who will be not only smart but
elastic-minded to a fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big
company.</span> <span class="s s55">Big companies are biased against new technologies, and
the people you'd meet there would be wrong too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">In an essay I wrote for high school students, 
I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- to
work on things that maximize your future options.</span> <span class="s s57">The principle
applies for adults too, though perhaps it has to be modified to:
stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential
energy you've accumulated when you need to pay for kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">I don't think people consciously realize this, but one reason
downwind jobs like churning out Java for a bank pay so well is 
precisely that they are downwind.</span> <span class="s s59">The market price for that kind
of work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future.</span>
<span class="s s60">A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to pay
less, because part of the compensation is in the form of the new
skills you'll learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Grad school is the other end of the spectrum from a coding job at
a big company: the pay's low but you spend most of your time working
on new stuff.</span> <span class="s s62">And of course, it's called "school," which makes
that clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentage
school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">The right environment for having startup ideas need not be a
university per se.</span> <span class="s s64">It just has to be a situation with a large
percentage of school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">It's obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do 
you need other people?</span> <span class="s s66">Can't you just think of new ideas yourself?</span>
<span class="s s67">The empirical answer is: no.</span> <span class="s s68">Even Einstein needed people to bounce
ideas off.</span> <span class="s s69">Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them
to the right kind of person.</span> <span class="s s70">You need that resistance, just
as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in 
startups with only one founder.</span> <span class="s s72">Practically every successful company
has at least two.</span> <span class="s s73">And because startup founders work under great 
pressure, it's critical they be friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">I didn't realize it till I was writing this, but that may help
explain why there are so few female startup founders.</span> <span class="s s75">I read on
the Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.</span><span class="s s76">7% of VC-backed
startups are founded by women.</span> <span class="s s77">The percentage of female hackers
is small, but not that small.</span> <span class="s s78">So why the discrepancy?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">When you realize that successful startups tend to have multiple
founders who were already friends, a
possible explanation emerges.</span> <span class="s s80">People's best friends are likely to 
be of the same sex, and if one group is a minority in some population,
pairs of them will be a minority squared.</span>
<span class="s s81">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">Doodling</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">What these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated 
than just sitting down and trying to think of ideas.</span> <span class="s s84">I suspect the 
most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich.</span>
<span class="s s85">Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere.</span>
<span class="s s86">Then, the next morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about
how to solve it.</span> <span class="s s87">He runs eagerly to to tell the others, and together
they work out the kinks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">What happens in that shower? It seems to me that ideas just pop
into my head. But can we say more than that?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">Taking a shower is like a form of meditation.</span> <span class="s s90">You're alert, but
there's nothing to distract you.</span> <span class="s s91">It's in a situation like this,
where your mind is free to roam, that it bumps into new ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">What happens when your mind wanders?</span> <span class="s s93">It may be like doodling.</span> <span class="s s94">Most
people have characteristic ways of doodling.</span> <span class="s s95">This habit is 
unconscious, but not random: I found my doodles changed after I 
started studying painting.</span> <span class="s s96">I started to make the kind of gestures
I'd make if I were drawing from life.</span> <span class="s s97">They were atoms of drawing, 
but arranged randomly.</span>
<span class="s s98">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas.</span> <span class="s s100">You
have certain mental gestures you've learned in your work, and when
you're not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures, 
but somewhat randomly.</span> <span class="s s101">In effect, you call the same functions on
random arguments.</span> <span class="s s102">That's what a metaphor is: a function applied 
to an argument of the wrong type.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">Conveniently, as I was writing this, my mind wandered: would it be
useful to have metaphors in a programming language?</span> <span class="s s104">I don't know;
I don't have time to think about this.</span> <span class="s s105">But it's convenient because
this is an example of what I mean by habits of mind.</span> <span class="s s106">I spend a lot
of time thinking about language design, and my habit of always 
asking "would x be useful in a programming language" just got
invoked.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s107">If new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you have
to work at something for a while before you have any.</span> <span class="s s108">It's not
just that you can't judge ideas till you're an expert in a field.</span>
<span class="s s109">You won't even generate ideas, because you won't have any habits
of mind to invoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">Of course the habits of mind you invoke on some field don't have
to be derived from working in that field.</span> <span class="s s111">In fact, it's often
better if they're not.</span> <span class="s s112">You're not just looking for good ideas, but
for good new ideas, and you have a better chance of generating
those if you combine stuff from distant fields.</span> <span class="s s113">As hackers, one
of our habits of mind is to ask, could one open-source x?</span> <span class="s s114">For 
example, what if you made an open-source operating system?</span> <span class="s s115">A fine
idea, but not very novel.</span> <span class="s s116">Whereas if you ask, could you make an
open-source play?</span> <span class="s s117">you might be onto something.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">Are some kinds of work better sources of habits of mind than others?</span>
<span class="s s119">I suspect harder fields may be better sources, because to attack
hard problems you need powerful solvents.</span> <span class="s s120">I find math is a good
source of metaphors-- good enough that it's worth studying just for
that.</span> <span class="s s121">Related fields are also good sources, especially when they're
related in unexpected ways.</span> <span class="s s122">Everyone knows computer science and
electrical engineering are related, but precisely because everyone
knows it, importing ideas from one to the other doesn't yield great
profits.</span> <span class="s s123">It's like importing something from Wisconsin to Michigan.</span> 
<span class="s s124">Whereas (I claim) hacking and painting are
also related, in the sense that hackers and painters are both 
makers,
and this source of new ideas is practically virgin territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">In theory you could stick together ideas at random and see what you
came up with.</span> <span class="s s127">What if you built a peer-to-peer dating site?</span> <span class="s s128">Would
it be useful to have an automatic book?</span> <span class="s s129">Could you turn theorems
into a commodity?</span> <span class="s s130">When you assemble ideas at random like this, 
they may not be just stupid, but semantically ill-formed.</span> <span class="s s131">What 
would it even mean to make theorems a commodity?</span> <span class="s s132">You got me.</span> <span class="s s133">I
didn't think of that idea, just its name.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">You might come up with something useful this way, but I never have.</span>
<span class="s s135">It's like knowing a fabulous sculpture is hidden inside a block of
marble, and all you have to do is remove the marble that isn't part
of it.</span> <span class="s s136">It's an encouraging thought, because it reminds you there 
is an answer, but it's not much use in practice because the search
space is too big.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s137">I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem.</span>
<span class="s s138">You can't start with randomness.</span> <span class="s s139">You have to start with a problem,
then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s140">In a way, it's harder to see problems than their solutions.</span> <span class="s s141">Most 
people prefer to remain in denial about problems. It's obvious
why: problems are irritating.</span> <span class="s s142">They're problems!</span> <span class="s s143">Imagine if people
in 1700 saw their lives the way we'd see them.</span> <span class="s s144">It would have been
unbearable.</span> <span class="s s145">This denial is such a powerful force that, even when 
presented with possible solutions, people often prefer to believe
they wouldn't work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s146">I saw this phenomenon when I worked on spam filters.</span> <span class="s s147">In 2002, most
people preferred to ignore spam, and most of those who didn't
preferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were the
best you could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s148">I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to
recognize it statistically.</span> <span class="s s149">And it turns out that was all you 
needed to solve the problem.</span> <span class="s s150">The algorithm I used was ridiculously
simple.</span> <span class="s s151">Anyone who'd really tried to solve the problem would have
found it.</span> <span class="s s152">It was just that no one had really tried to solve the
problem.</span>
<span class="s s153">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s154">Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and 
feeling it must be possible to solve it.</span> <span class="s s155">Simple as it seems, that's
the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s156">Wealth</span></p>
<p><span class="s s157">So far most of what I've said applies to ideas in general.</span> <span class="s s158">What's 
special about startup ideas?</span> <span class="s s159">Startup ideas are ideas for companies,
and companies have to make money.</span> <span class="s s160">And the way to make money is to
make something people want.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">Wealth is what people want. I don't mean that as some kind of 
philosophical statement; I mean it as a tautology.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s162">So an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want.</span>
<span class="s s163">Wouldn't any good idea be something people want?</span> <span class="s s164">Unfortunately 
not.</span> <span class="s s165">I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but there
is no great demand for them.</span> <span class="s s166">Whereas there appears to be great
demand for celebrity gossip magazines.</span> <span class="s s167">Wealth is defined democratically.</span>
<span class="s s168">Good ideas and valuable ideas are not quite the same thing; the
difference is individual tastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">But valuable ideas are very close to good ideas, especially in
technology.</span> <span class="s s170">I think they're so close that you can get away with
working as if the goal were to discover good ideas, so long as, in
the final stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for 
this?</span> <span class="s s171">Only a few ideas are likely to make it that far and then get
shot down; RPN calculators might be one example.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">One way to make something people want is to look at stuff people 
use now that's broken.</span> <span class="s s173">Dating sites are a prime example.</span> <span class="s s174">They 
have millions of users, so they must be promising something people 
want.</span> <span class="s s175">And yet they work horribly.</span> <span class="s s176">Just ask anyone who uses them.</span> 
<span class="s s177">It's as if they used the worse-is-better approach but stopped after
the first stage and handed the thing over to marketers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">Of course, the most obvious breakage in the average computer user's 
life is Windows itself.</span> <span class="s s179">But this is a special case: you can't
defeat a monopoly by a frontal attack.</span> <span class="s s180">Windows can and will be 
overthrown, but not by giving people a better desktop OS.</span> <span class="s s181">The way
to kill it is to redefine the problem as a superset of the current 
one.</span> <span class="s s182">The problem is not, what operating system should people use
on desktop computers?</span> <span class="s s183">but how should people use applications?</span>
<span class="s s184">There are answers to that question that don't even involve desktop
computers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s185">Everyone thinks Google is going to solve this problem, but it is a
very subtle one, so subtle that a company as big as Google might
well get it wrong.</span> <span class="s s186">I think the odds are better than 50-50 that the
Windows killer-- or more accurately, Windows transcender-- will
come from some little startup.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s187">Another classic way to make something people want is to take a
luxury and make it into a commmodity.</span> <span class="s s188">People must want something
if they pay a lot for it.</span> <span class="s s189">And it is a very rare product that can't
be made dramatically cheaper if you try.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s190">This was Henry Ford's plan.</span> <span class="s s191">He made cars, which had been a luxury
item, into a commodity.</span> <span class="s s192">But the idea is much older than Henry Ford.</span>
<span class="s s193">Water mills transformed mechanical power from a luxury into a
commodity, and they were used in the Roman empire.</span> <span class="s s194">Arguably
pastoralism transformed a luxury into a commodity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s195">When you make something cheaper you can sell more of them.</span> <span class="s s196">But if
you make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitative
changes, because people start to use it in different ways.</span> <span class="s s197">For
example, once computers get so cheap that most people can have one
of their own, you can use them as communication devices.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine 
the problem.</span> <span class="s s199">The Model T didn't have all the features previous
cars did.</span> <span class="s s200">It only came in black, for example.</span> <span class="s s201">But it solved the
problem people cared most about, which was getting from place to
place.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s202">One of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from Michael
Rabin: that the best way to solve a problem is often to redefine
it.</span> <span class="s s203">A lot of people use this technique without being consciously
aware of it, but Rabin was spectacularly explicit.</span> <span class="s s204">You need a big
prime number?</span> <span class="s s205">Those are pretty expensive.</span> <span class="s s206">How about if I give you
a big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not being
prime?</span> <span class="s s207">Would that do?</span> <span class="s s208">Well, probably; I mean, that's probably
smaller than the chance that I'm imagining all this anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s209">Redefining the problem is a particularly juicy heuristic when you
have competitors, because it's so hard for rigid-minded people to 
follow.</span> <span class="s s210">You can work in plain sight and they don't realize the 
danger.</span> <span class="s s211">Don't worry about us.</span> <span class="s s212">We're just working on search.</span> <span class="s s213">Do 
one thing and do it well, that's our motto.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s214">Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general
technique: making things easier.</span> <span class="s s215">For a long time it was most of 
making things easier, but now that the things we build are so
complicated, there's another rapidly growing subset: making things 
easier to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s216">This is an area where there's great room for improvement.</span> <span class="s s217">What you
want to be able to say about technology is: it just works.</span> <span class="s s218">How
often do you say that now?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">Simplicity takes effort-- genius, even.</span> <span class="s s220">The average programmer 
seems to produce UI designs that are almost willfully bad.</span> <span class="s s221">I was 
trying to use the stove at my mother's house a couple weeks ago.</span> 
<span class="s s222">It was a new one, and instead of physical knobs it had buttons and
an LED display.</span> <span class="s s223">I tried pressing some buttons I thought would cause
it to get hot, and you know what it said?</span> <span class="s s224">"Err.</span><span class="s s225">"</span> <span class="s s226">Not even "Error.</span><span class="s s227">"</span>
<span class="s s228">"Err.</span><span class="s s229">"</span> <span class="s s230">You can't just say "Err" to the user of a stove.</span>
<span class="s s231">You should design the UI so that errors are impossible.</span> <span class="s s232">And the 
boneheads who designed this stove even had an example of such a UI
to work from: the old one.</span> <span class="s s233">You turn one knob to set the temperature
and another to set the timer.</span> <span class="s s234">What was wrong with that?</span> <span class="s s235">It just
worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s236">It seems that, for the average engineer, more options just means
more rope to hang yourself.</span> <span class="s s237">So if you want to start a startup, you
can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, 
and assume you could build something way easier to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s238">Design for Exit</span></p>
<p><span class="s s239">Success for a startup approximately equals getting bought.</span> <span class="s s240">You
need some kind of exit strategy, because you can't get the smartest
people to work for you without giving them options likely to be
worth something.</span> <span class="s s241">Which means you either have to get bought or go
public, and the number of startups that go public is very small.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s242">If success probably means getting bought, should you make that a
conscious goal?</span> <span class="s s243">The old answer was no: you were supposed to pretend
that you wanted to create a giant, public company, and act surprised
when someone made you an offer.</span> <span class="s s244">Really, you want to buy us?</span> <span class="s s245">Well,
I suppose we'd consider it, for the right price.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s246">I think things are changing.</span> <span class="s s247">If 98% of the time success means 
getting bought, why not be open about it?</span> <span class="s s248">If 98% of the time you're
doing product development on spec for some big company, why not
think of that as your task?</span> <span class="s s249">One advantage of this approach is that
it gives you another source of ideas: look at big companies, think
what they should 
be doing, and do it yourself.</span> <span class="s s250">Even if
they already know it, you'll probably be done faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s251">Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want.</span> <span class="s s252">Don't
fix Windows, because the only potential acquirer is Microsoft, and 
when there's only one acquirer, they don't have to hurry.</span> <span class="s s253">They can
take their time and copy you instead of buying you.</span> <span class="s s254">If you want
to get market price, work on something where there's competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s255">If an increasing number of startups are created to do product
development on spec, it will be a natural counterweight to monopolies.</span>
<span class="s s256">Once some type of technology is captured by a monopoly, it will 
only evolve at big company rates instead of startup rates, whereas
alternatives will evolve with especial speed.</span> <span class="s s257">A free market
interprets monopoly as damage and routes around it.</span></p>

<p><span class="s s259">The most productive way to generate startup ideas is also the
most unlikely-sounding: by accident.</span> <span class="s s260">If you look at how famous
startups got started, a lot of them weren't initially supposed to 
be startups.</span> <span class="s s261">Lotus began with a program Mitch Kapor wrote for a
friend.</span> <span class="s s262">Apple got started because Steve Wozniak wanted to build
microcomputers, and his employer, Hewlett-Packard, wouldn't let him
do it at work.</span> <span class="s s263">Yahoo began as David Filo's personal collection of
links.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s264">This is not the only way to start startups.</span> <span class="s s265">You can sit down and
consciously come up with an idea for a company; we did.</span> <span class="s s266">But measured
in total market cap, the build-stuff-for-yourself model might be 
more fruitful.</span> <span class="s s267">It certainly has to be the most fun way to come up
with startup ideas.</span> <span class="s s268">And since a startup ought to have multiple
founders who were already friends before they decided to start a 
company, the rather surprising conclusion is that the best way to 
generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook up
amusing hacks with your friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s269">It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but there
it is: the best way to get a "million dollar idea" is just to do
what hackers enjoy doing anyway.</span></p>

This phenomenon may account for a number of discrepancies
currently blamed on various forbidden isms. Never attribute to 
malice what can be explained by math.</span></p>

A lot of classic abstract expressionism is doodling of this type:
artists trained to paint from life using the same gestures but
without using them to represent anything.</span> <span class="s s273">This explains why such
paintings are (slightly) more interesting than random marks would be.</span></p>

Bill Yerazunis had solved the problem, but he got there by
another path.</span> <span class="s s275">He made a general-purpose file classifier so good
that it also worked for spam.</span></p>
