  <h2><span class="s s1">Copy What You Like</span></h2>
<div><div><span class="s s2">July 2006
When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad
writers.</span> <span class="s s3">What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction,
so I assumed that was the highest form of writing.</span> <span class="s s4">Mistake number
one.</span> <span class="s s5">The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which
people suffered in complicated ways.</span> <span class="s s6">Anything funny or
gripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough to be hard to
understand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer.</span> <span class="s s7">Mistake number two.</span> <span class="s s8">The
ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had
quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine
publishing.</span> <span class="s s9">But since their size made them perfect for use in
high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the
impression the short story was flourishing.</span> <span class="s s10">Mistake number three.</span>
<span class="s s11">And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you
could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was
considered advanced.</span> <span class="s s12">Mistake number four.</span> <span class="s s13">The result was that I
wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone
was unhappy in a way that seemed deep.</span><span class="s s14">For most of college I was a philosophy major.</span> <span class="s s15">I was very impressed
by the papers published in philosophy journals.</span> <span class="s s16">They were so
beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating&acirc;&#128;&#148;alternately
casual and buffer-overflowingly technical.</span> <span class="s s17">A fellow would be walking
along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon
him.</span> <span class="s s18">I didn't ever quite understand these papers, but I figured
I'd get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more
closely.</span> <span class="s s19">In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them.</span> <span class="s s20">This
was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, because they weren't
really saying anything.</span> <span class="s s21">No philosopher ever refuted another, for
example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute.</span>
<span class="s s22">Needless to say, my imitations didn't say anything either.</span><span class="s s23">In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things.</span>
<span class="s s24">There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system,
at the core of which was something called an inference engine.</span> <span class="s s25">I
looked at what these things did and thought "I could write that in
a thousand lines of code.</span><span class="s s26">"</span> <span class="s s27">And yet eminent professors were writing
books about them, and startups were selling them for a year's salary
a copy.</span> <span class="s s28">What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things
seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp.</span> <span class="s s29">Wrong.</span> <span class="s s30">It was simply a
fad.</span> <span class="s s31">The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now
ignored.</span> <span class="s s32">They were not even on a path to anything interesting.</span>
<span class="s s33">And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same
government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet
seats.</span><span class="s s34">How do you avoid copying the wrong things?</span> <span class="s s35">Copy only what you
genuinely like.</span> <span class="s s36">That would have saved me in all three cases.</span> <span class="s s37">I
didn't enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes;
I didn't learn anything from philosophy papers; I didn't use expert
systems myself.</span> <span class="s s38">I believed these things were good because they
were admired.</span><span class="s s39">It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things
you're impressed with.</span> <span class="s s40">One trick is to ignore presentation.</span> <span class="s s41">Whenever
I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how
much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and
frameless, and with no idea who painted it?</span> <span class="s s42">If you walk around a
museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly
startling results.</span> <span class="s s43">Don't ignore this data point just because it's
an outlier.</span><span class="s s44">Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy
as guilty pleasures.</span> <span class="s s45">Many things people like, especially if they're
young and ambitious, they like largely for the feeling of virtue
in liking them.</span> <span class="s s46">99% of people reading Ulysses are thinking
"I'm reading Ulysses" as they do it.</span> <span class="s s47">A guilty pleasure is
at least a pure one.</span> <span class="s s48">What do you read when you don't feel up to being
virtuous?</span> <span class="s s49">What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there's
only half of it left, instead of being impressed that you're half
way through?</span> <span class="s s50">That's what you really like.</span><span class="s s51">Even when you find genuinely good things to copy, there's another
pitfall to be avoided.</span> <span class="s s52">Be careful to copy what makes them good,
rather than their flaws.</span> <span class="s s53">It's easy to be drawn into imitating
flaws, because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy
too.</span> <span class="s s54">For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries used brownish colors.</span> <span class="s s55">They were imitating the great
painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown
with dirt.</span> <span class="s s56">Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing
brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.</span><span class="s s57">It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong
things.</span> <span class="s s58">Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being
a painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it
snapped the leash of credulity.</span> <span class="s s59">These people made philosophy
professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians.</span> <span class="s s60">It was so clearly
a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced
to see the distinction.</span> <span class="s s61">It's there to some degree in almost every
field, but I had till then managed to avoid facing it.</span><span class="s s62">That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting:
you have to figure out for yourself what's 
good.</span> <span class="s s63">You can't trust
authorities.</span> <span class="s s64">They'll lie to you on this one.</span>
