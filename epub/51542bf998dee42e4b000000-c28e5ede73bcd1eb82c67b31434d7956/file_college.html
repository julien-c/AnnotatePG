<p><span class="s s2">

March 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to
me with questions.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">Recently I've had several emails from computer science
undergrads asking what to do in college.</span> <span class="s s5">I might not
be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in
college.</span> <span class="s s6">But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought
I was one.</span> <span class="s s7">I was certainly a hacker, at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">Hacking</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">What should you do in college to become a 
good hacker?</span> <span class="s s10">There are two
main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn
a lot about specific, cool problems. These turn out to be equivalent,
because each drives you to do the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hard
problems. And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is
to work on some very engaging project.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s12">Odds are this project won't be a class assignment.</span> <span class="s s13">My friend Robert
learned a lot by writing network software when he was an
undergrad.</span> <span class="s s14">One of his projects was to connect Harvard to the
Arpanet; it had been one of the original nodes, but by 1984 the
connection had died.</span> <span class="s s15">[1] Not only was this
work not for a class, but because he spent all his time on it
and neglected his studies, he was kicked out of
school for a year.</span> <span class="s s16">[2] It all evened out in the end, and now he's
a professor at MIT.</span> <span class="s s17">But you'll probably be happier if you don't
go to that extreme; it caused him a lot of worry at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">Another way to be good at programming is to find other people who
are good at it, and learn what they know.</span> <span class="s s19">Programmers tend to sort
themselves into tribes according to the type of work they do and
the tools they use, and some tribes are 
smarter than others.</span> <span class="s s20">Look
around you and see what the smart people seem to be working on;
there's usually a reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">Some of the smartest people around you are professors.</span> <span class="s s22">So one way
to find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant.</span>
<span class="s s23">Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious
system-administration type problems for them, so that is a way to
get a foot in the door.</span> <span class="s s24">What they fear are
flakes and resume padders.</span> <span class="s s25">It's all too
common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work.</span> <span class="s s26">So
you have to make it clear you'll mean a net decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">Don't be put off if they say no.</span> <span class="s s28">Rejection is almost always less
personal than the rejectee imagines.</span> <span class="s s29">Just move on to the next.</span>
<span class="s s30">(This applies to dating too.</span><span class="s s31">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Beware, because although most professors are smart, not all of them
work on interesting stuff.</span> <span class="s s33">Professors have to publish novel results
to advance their careers, but there is more competition in more
interesting areas of research.</span> <span class="s s34">So what less ambitious professors
do is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel because
no one else cares about them.</span> <span class="s s35">You're better off avoiding these.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">I never worked as a research assistant, so I feel a bit dishonest
recommending that route.</span> <span class="s s37">I learned to program by writing stuff of
my own, particularly by trying to reverse-engineer Winograd's
SHRDLU.</span> <span class="s s38">I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself, the advantage
is that the project is all your own.</span> <span class="s s40">You never have to compromise
or ask anyone's permission, and if you have a new idea you can just
sit down and start implementing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">In your own projects you don't have to worry about novelty (as
professors do) or profitability (as businesses do).</span> <span class="s s42">All that matters
is how hard the project is technically, and that has no correlation
to the nature of the application.</span> <span class="s s43">"Serious" applications like 
databases are often trivial and dull technically (if you ever suffer
from insomnia, try reading the technical literature about databases)
while "frivolous" applications like games are often very sophisticated.</span>
<span class="s s44">I'm sure there are game companies out there working on products
with more intellectual content than the research at the
bottom nine tenths of university CS departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">If I were in college now I'd probably work on
graphics: a network game, for example, or a tool for 3D animation.</span>
<span class="s s46">When I was an undergrad there weren't enough cycles around to make
graphics interesting, but it's hard to imagine anything more fun
to work on now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">Math</span></p>
<p><span class="s s48">When I was in college, a lot of the professors believed (or at least
wished) that 
computer science was a branch of math.</span> <span class="s s49">This idea was
strongest at Harvard, where there wasn't even a CS major till the
1980s; till then one had to major in applied math.</span> <span class="s s50">But it was
nearly as bad at Cornell.</span> <span class="s s51">When I told the fearsome Professor Conway
that I was interested in AI (a hot topic then), he told me I should
major in math.</span> <span class="s s52">I'm still not sure whether he thought AI required
math, or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring in
something rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">In fact, the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less 
than most university departments like to admit.</span> <span class="s s54">I don't think you 
need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from the
theory of computation.</span> <span class="s s55">(You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is
if you want to avoid writing them.</span><span class="s s56">) Unless you're planning to write
math applications, of course.</span> <span class="s s57">Robotics, for example, is all math.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">But while you don't literally need math for most kinds of hacking,
in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas, 
math is very much worth studying for its own sake.</span> <span class="s s59">It's a 
valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work.</span><span class="s s60">[3] I wish 
I'd studied more math in college for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Like a lot of people, I was mathematically abused as a child.</span> <span class="s s62">I 
learned to think of math as a collection of formulas that were
neither beautiful nor had any relation to my life (despite attempts
to translate them into "word problems"), but had to be memorized 
in order to do well on tests.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">One of the most valuable things you could do in college would be
to learn what math is really about.</span> <span class="s s64">This may not be easy, because
a lot of good mathematicians are bad teachers.</span> <span class="s s65">And while there are
many popular books on math, few seem good.</span> <span class="s s66">The best I can think
of are W.</span> <span class="s s67">W.</span> <span class="s s68">Sawyer's.</span> <span class="s s69">And of course Euclid.</span> <span class="s s70">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">Everything</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">Thomas Huxley said "Try to learn something about everything and 
everything about something." Most universities aim at this
ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s73">But what's everything?</span> <span class="s s74">To me it means, all that people
learn in the course of working honestly on hard problems. All such 
work tends to be related, in that ideas and techniques from one 
field can often be transplanted successfully to others.</span> <span class="s s75">Even others
that seem quite distant.</span> <span class="s s76">For example, I write 
essays the same way
I write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fast
as I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">Working on hard problems is not, by itself, enough.</span> <span class="s s78">Medieval 
alchemists were working on a hard problem, but their approach was 
so bogus that there was little
to learn from studying it, except possibly about people's ability 
to delude themselves.</span> <span class="s s79">Unfortunately the sort of AI I was trying 
to learn in college had the same flaw: a very hard problem, blithely
approached with hopelessly inadequate techniques.</span> <span class="s s80">Bold?</span> <span class="s s81">Closer 
to fraudulent.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s83">The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they're so much 
influenced by intellectual fashions.</span> <span class="s s84">If a 
physicist met a colleague
from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist
met a colleague from 100 years ago, they'd just get into an
ideological argument.</span>
<span class="s s85">Yes, of course, you'll learn something by taking a
psychology class.</span> <span class="s s86">The point is, you'll learn more by taking
a class in another department.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s87">The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hard
sciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social 
history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics.</span>
<span class="s s88">A survey course in art history may be worthwhile.</span> <span class="s s89">Modern literature
is important, but the way to learn about it is just to read.</span> <span class="s s90">I
don't know enough about music to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">You can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the various
departments created recently in response to political pressures.</span>
<span class="s s92">Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly.</span> <span class="s s93">But
the way they talk about them is useless.</span> <span class="s s94">For example, philosophy 
talks, among other things, about our obligations to one another; 
but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E.</span> <span class="s s95">B.</span>
<span class="s s96">White than from an academic philosopher.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">I speak here from experience.</span> <span class="s s98">I should probably have been offended 
when people laughed at Clinton for saying "It depends on what the 
meaning of the word 'is' is.</span><span class="s s99">"</span> <span class="s s100">I took about five classes in college
on what the meaning of "is" is.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s101">Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to 
create the dropout graph.</span> <span class="s s102">For example, I know many people 
who switched from math to computer science because they found math 
too hard, and no one who did the opposite.</span> <span class="s s103">People don't do hard
things gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless 
it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding.</span> <span class="s s104">So
probably math is more worth studying than computer science.</span> <span class="s s105">By
similar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in
a university.</span> <span class="s s106">At the bottom you'll find the subjects with least 
intellectual content.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s107">If you use this method, you'll get roughly the same answer I just 
gave.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">Language courses are an anomaly.</span> <span class="s s109">I think they're better considered
as extracurricular activities, like pottery classes.</span> <span class="s s110">They'd be far
more useful when combined with some time living in a country where 
the language is spoken.</span> <span class="s s111">On a whim I studied Arabic as a freshman.</span>
<span class="s s112">It was a lot of work, and the only lasting benefits were a weird 
ability to identify semitic roots and some insights into how people
recognize words.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">Studio art and creative writing courses are wildcards.</span> <span class="s s114">Usually 
you don't get taught much: you just work (or don't work) on whatever
you want, and then sit around offering "crits" of one another's
creations under the vague supervision of the teacher.</span> <span class="s s115">But writing and
art are both very hard problems that (some) people work honestly
at, so they're worth doing, especially if you can find a good
teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s116">Jobs</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">Of course college students have to think about more than just
learning.</span> <span class="s s118">There are also two practical problems to consider: jobs,
and graduate school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">In theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training.</span>
<span class="s s120">But everyone knows this is a bit of a fib.</span> <span class="s s121">Hackers at every college
learn practical skills, and not by accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">What you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want.</span>
<span class="s s123">If you want to work in a big company, learn how to hack 
Blub on
Windows.</span> <span class="s s124">If you want to work at a cool little company or research 
lab, you'll do better to learn Ruby on Linux.</span> <span class="s s125">And if you want to 
start your own company, which I think will be more and more common,
master the most powerful tools you can find, because you're going
to be in a race against your competitors, and they'll be your horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">There is not a direct correlation between the skills you should 
learn in college and those you'll use in a job.</span> <span class="s s127">You should aim 
slightly high in college.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">In workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds, even
though he may never have to exert anything like that much force in
the course of a game.</span> <span class="s s129">Likewise, if your professors try to make you
learn stuff that's more advanced than you'll need in a job, it may
not just be because they're academics, detached from the real world.</span>
<span class="s s130">They may be trying to make you lift weights with your brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s131">The programs you write in classes differ in three critical ways
from the ones you'll write in the real world: they're small; you
get to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial 
and predetermined.</span> <span class="s s132">In the real world, programs are bigger, tend 
to involve existing code, and often require you to figure out what 
the problem is before you can solve it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s133">You don't have to wait to leave (or even enter) college to learn 
these skills.</span> <span class="s s134">If you want to learn how to deal with existing code,
for example, you can contribute to open-source projects.</span> <span class="s s135">The sort
of employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as 
good grades on class assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s136">In existing open-source projects you don't get much practice at
the third skill, deciding what problems to solve.</span> <span class="s s137">But there's 
nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own.</span> <span class="s s138">And good
employers will be even more impressed
with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">What sort of problem should you try to solve?</span> <span class="s s140">One way to answer
that is to ask what you need as a user.</span> <span class="s s141">For example, I stumbled
on a good algorithm for spam filtering because I wanted to stop 
getting spam.</span> <span class="s s142">Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehow
prevented my inbox from filling up.</span> <span class="s s143">I tend to use my inbox as a
todo list.</span> <span class="s s144">But that's like using a screwdriver to open
bottles; what one really wants is a bottle opener.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">Grad School</span></p>
<p><span class="s s146">What about grad school? Should you go? And how do you get into a 
good one?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s147">In principle, grad school is professional training in research, and
you shouldn't go unless you want to do research as a career.</span> <span class="s s148">And 
yet half the people who get PhDs in CS don't go into research.</span>
<span class="s s149">I didn't go to grad school to become a professor.</span> <span class="s s150">I went because 
I wanted to learn more.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s151">So if you're mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school,
you'll find a lot of other people who are similarly out of their 
element.</span> <span class="s s152">And if half the people around you are out of their element in the
same way you are, are you really out of your element?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">There's a fundamental problem in "computer science," and it surfaces
in situations like this.</span> <span class="s s154">No one is sure what "research" is supposed to be.</span> 
<span class="s s155">A lot
of research is hacking that had to be crammed into the form of an
academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s156">So it's kind of misleading to ask whether you'll be at home in grad
school, because very few people are quite at home in computer
science.</span> <span class="s s157">The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin.</span> <span class="s s158">So
the fact that you're mainly interested in hacking shouldn't deter 
you from going to grad school.</span> <span class="s s159">Just be warned you'll have to do a lot of stuff 
you don't like.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s160">Number one will be your dissertation.</span> <span class="s s161">Almost everyone hates their
dissertation by the time they're done with it.</span> <span class="s s162">The
process inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made out
of whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours.</span> <span class="s s163">Few dissertations 
are read with pleasure, especially by their authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s164">But thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation.</span>
<span class="s s165">And aside from that, grad school is close to paradise.</span> <span class="s s166">Many people
remember it as the happiest time of their lives.</span> <span class="s s167">And nearly all
the rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have 
been, if they hadn't had to write a dissertation.</span> <span class="s s168">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">The danger with grad school is that you don't see the scary part
upfront.</span> <span class="s s170">PhD programs start out as college part 2, with several
years of classes.</span> <span class="s s171">So by the time you face the horror of writing a 
dissertation, you're already several years in.</span> <span class="s s172">If you quit now,
you'll be a grad-school dropout, and you probably won't like that
idea.</span> <span class="s s173">When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing the
Internet worm of 1988, I envied him enormously for finding a way out
without the stigma of failure.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s175">On the whole, grad school is probably better than most alternatives.</span> <span class="s s176">You meet a 
lot of smart people, and your glum procrastination will at least 
be a powerful common bond.</span> <span class="s s177">And of course you have a PhD at the
end.</span> <span class="s s178">I forgot about that.</span> <span class="s s179">I suppose that's worth something.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">The greatest advantage of a PhD (besides being the union card of
academia, of course) may be that it gives you some baseline confidence.</span>
<span class="s s181">For example, the Honeywell thermostats in my house have the most
atrocious UI.</span> <span class="s s182">My mother, who has the same model, diligently spent
a day reading the user's manual to learn how to operate hers.</span> <span class="s s183">She
assumed the problem was with her.</span> <span class="s s184">But I can think to myself "If
someone with a PhD in computer science can't understand this
thermostat, it must be badly 
designed.</span><span class="s s185">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s186">If you still want to go to grad school after this equivocal
recommendation, I can give you solid advice about how to get in.</span> 
<span class="s s187">A lot of my friends are CS professors now, so I have the inside
story about admissions.</span> <span class="s s188">It's quite different from college.</span> <span class="s s189">At
most colleges, admissions officers decide who gets in.</span> <span class="s s190">For PhD
programs, the professors do.</span> <span class="s s191">And they try to do
it well, because the people they admit are going to be working for
them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">Apparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools.</span>
<span class="s s193">Standardized tests count for nothing, and grades for little.</span> <span class="s s194">The
essay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by saying 
something stupid.</span> <span class="s s195">The only thing professors
trust is recommendations, preferably from people they know.</span> <span class="s s196">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s197">So if you want to get into a PhD program, the key is to impress
your professors.</span> <span class="s s198">And from my friends who are professors I know 
what impresses them: not merely trying to impress them.</span> <span class="s s199">They're
not impressed by students who get good grades or want to be their
research assistants so they can get into grad school.</span> <span class="s s200">They're
impressed by students who get good grades and want to be their 
research assistants because they're genuinely interested in the 
topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s201">So the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to get
into grad school or just be good at hacking, is figure out what you
truly like.</span> <span class="s s202">It's hard to trick professors into letting you into
grad school, and impossible to trick problems into letting you solve
them.</span> <span class="s s203">College is where faking stops working.</span> <span class="s s204">From this point,
unless you want to go work for a big company, which is like reverting
to high school, the only way forward is through doing what you 
love.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s205">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s206">
[1] No one seems to have minded, which shows how unimportant
the Arpanet (which became the Internet) was as late as
1984.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s207">[2] This is why, when I became an employer, I didn't care
about GPAs.</span> <span class="s s208">In fact, we actively sought out people 
who'd failed out of school.</span> <span class="s s209">We once put up posters around Harvard
saying "Did you just get kicked out for doing badly in your classes
because you spent all your time working on some project of your 
own?</span> <span class="s s210">Come work for us!</span><span class="s s211">"</span> <span class="s s212">We managed to find a kid who had been, 
and he was a great hacker.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">When Harvard kicks undergrads out for a year, they have to get jobs.</span>
<span class="s s214">The idea is to show them how awful the real world is, so they'll 
understand how lucky they are to be in college.</span> <span class="s s215">This plan backfired
with the guy who came to work for us, because he had more fun than
he'd had in school, and made more that year from stock options than
any of his professors did in salary.</span> <span class="s s216">So instead of crawling back
repentant at the end of the year, he took another year off and went
to Europe.</span> <span class="s s217">He did eventually graduate at about 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">[3] Eric Raymond says the best metaphors for hackers are
in set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">Trevor Blackwell reminds you to take math classes intended for math majors.</span>
<span class="s s220">"'Math for engineers' classes sucked mightily.</span> <span class="s s221">In fact any 'x for
engineers' sucks, where x includes math, law, writing and visual
design.</span><span class="s s222">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s223">[4] Other highly recommended books: What is Mathematics?</span><span class="s s224">, by
Courant and Robbins; Geometry and the Imagination by Hilbert and 
Cohn-Vossen.</span>
<span class="s s225">And for those interested in graphic design,
Byrne's Euclid.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s226">[5] If you wanted to have the perfect life, the thing to do would
be to go to grad school, secretly write your dissertation in the
first year or two, and then just enjoy yourself for the next three
years, dribbling out a chapter at a time.</span> <span class="s s227">This prospect will make
grad students' mouths water, but I know of no one who's had the
discipline to pull it off.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s228">[6] One professor friend says that 15-20% of the grad students they
admit each year are "long shots.</span><span class="s s229">"</span> <span class="s s230">But what he means by long shots
are people whose applications are perfect in every way, except
that no one on the admissions committee knows the professors who
wrote the recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s231">So if you want to get into
grad school in the sciences, you need to go to college somewhere with
real research professors.</span> <span class="s s232">Otherwise you'll seem a risky bet
to admissions committees, no matter how good you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s233">Which implies
a surprising but apparently inevitable consequence:
little liberal arts colleges are doomed.</span>
