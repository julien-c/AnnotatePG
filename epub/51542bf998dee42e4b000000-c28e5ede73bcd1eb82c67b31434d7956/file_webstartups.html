<p><span class="s s2">
October 2007</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">There's something interesting happening right now.</span> <span class="s s5">Startups are
undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes
cheaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">It's a pattern we see over and over in technology.</span> <span class="s s7">Initially
there's some device that's very expensive and made
in small quantities.</span> <span class="s s8">Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; 
many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">Computers are a familiar example.</span> <span class="s s10">When I was a kid, computers were
big, expensive machines built one at a time.</span> <span class="s s11">Now they're a commodity.</span>
<span class="s s12">Now we can stick computers in everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">This pattern is very old.</span> <span class="s s14">Most of the turning
points in economic history are instances of it.</span> <span class="s s15">It happened to
steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s.</span>
<span class="s s16">It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating
the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance.</span> <span class="s s17">Agriculture
itself was an instance of this pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern
is happening to startups.</span> <span class="s s19">It's so cheap to start web startups
that orders of magnitudes more will be started.</span> <span class="s s20">If the pattern
holds true, that should cause dramatic changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">1. Lots of Startups</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">So my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty
straightforward: there will be a lot of them.</span> <span class="s s23">When starting a
startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors
to do it.</span> <span class="s s24">Now the only threshold is courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take
the plunge and survive.</span> <span class="s s26">In the last batch of startups we funded,
we had several founders who said they'd thought of applying before,
but weren't sure and got jobs instead.</span> <span class="s s27">It was only after hearing
reports of friends who'd done it that they decided to try it
themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,
and in some ways a worse kind of hard.</span> <span class="s s29">In a startup you have lots
of worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life is flying
by like you do in a big company.</span> <span class="s s30">Plus in a startup you could make
much more money.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow
to a point that would now seem surprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this
is the thinnest of historical veneers.</span> <span class="s s33">Just two or three
lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized
countries lived by farming.</span> <span class="s s34">So while it may seem surprising to
propose that large numbers of people will change the way they make
a living, it would be more surprising if they didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">2. Standardization</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization
always follows.</span> <span class="s s37">When you make things in large volumes you tend
to standardize everything that doesn't need to change.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s38">At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to
standardize everything.</span> <span class="s s39">We could hire employees, but we want to be
forced to figure out how to scale investing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, 
then let the needs of the users determine what to do
next.</span> <span class="s s41">In essense, let the market design the product.</span> <span class="s s42">We've
done the same thing ourselves.</span> <span class="s s43">We think of the techniques we're
developing for dealing with large numbers of startups as like
software.</span> <span class="s s44">Sometimes it literally is software, like 
Hacker News and
our application system.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">One of the most important things we've been working on standardizing
are investment terms. Till now investment terms have been
individually negotiated.</span>
<span class="s s46">This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money
take longer and cost more in legal fees.</span> <span class="s s47">So as well as using the
same paperwork for every deal we do, we've commissioned generic
angel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future
rounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s48">Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms.
Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will
be custom deals for the forseeable future.</span> <span class="s s49">But I think angel rounds
will start to be done mostly with standardized agreements.</span> <span class="s s50">An angel
who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement
is probably not one you want anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">3. New Attitude to Acquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Another thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.</span>
<span class="s s53">As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to
develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little
more work than hiring someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology.</span> <span class="s s55">They
buy a lot of startups&mdash; more than most people realize, because they
only announce a fraction of them.</span> <span class="s s56">And being Google, they're
figuring out how to do it efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">One problem they've solved is how to think about acquisitions.</span> <span class="s s58">For
most companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy.</span>
<span class="s s59">Companies do them because they have to, but there's usually some
feeling they shouldn't have to&mdash;that their own programmers should
be able to build everything they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">Google's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea.</span>
<span class="s s61">Google has by far the best programmers of any public technology
company.</span> <span class="s s62">If they don't have a problem doing acquisitions, the
others should have even less problem.</span> <span class="s s63">However many Google does,
Microsoft should do ten times as many.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">One reason Google doesn't have a problem with acquisitions
is that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get
that way.</span> <span class="s s65">Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the
rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding
no takers.</span> <span class="s s66">They've been the guys coming in to visit the big
company, so they know who might be sitting across that conference
table from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">4. Riskier Strategies are Possible</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">Risk is always proportionate to reward.</span> <span class="s s69">The way to get really big
returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search
engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding.</span> <span class="s s71">Founders
and investors have different attitudes to risk.</span> <span class="s s72">Knowing that risk
is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies,
while founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care
what's true on average, tend to be more conservative.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s73">If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because
founders can start them younger, when it's rational to take more
risk, and can start more startups total in their careers.</span> <span class="s s74">When
founders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the
world in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors.</span> <span class="s s75">And that
means the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, because
strategies can be riskier.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">5. Younger, Nerdier Founders</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">If startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to
have them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessors
made them cheap.</span> <span class="s s78">And in particular, younger and more technical
founders will be able to start startups than could before.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince
investors to let you do it.</span> <span class="s s80">And that required very different skills
from actually doing the startup.</span> <span class="s s81">If investors were perfect judges,
the two would require exactly the same skills.</span> <span class="s s82">But unfortunately
most investors are terrible judges.</span> <span class="s s83">I know because I see behind
the scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money,
and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely
proportional to the judgement of the buyers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there's another way
to convince investors.</span> <span class="s s85">Instead of going to venture capitalists
with a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, you
can get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollars
of seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with a
working company instead of a plan for one.</span> <span class="s s86">Then instead of
having to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to
Alexa.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s87">This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who
often went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortable
with the amount of fakeness required in other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">6. Startup Hubs Will Persist</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">It might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the
end of startup hubs like Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s90">If all you need to start
a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">This is kind of true and kind of false.</span> <span class="s s92">It's true that you can now
start a startup anywhere.</span> <span class="s s93">But you have to do more with a
startup than just start it.</span> <span class="s s94">You have to make it succeed.</span> <span class="s s95">And that
is more likely to happen in a startup hub.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">I've thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the
increasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase the
importance of startup hubs.</span> <span class="s s97">The value of startup hubs, like centers
for any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned:
face to face meetings.</span> <span class="s s98">No technology in the immediate future will
replace walking down University Ave and running into a friend who
tells you how to fix a bug that's been bothering you all weekend,
or visiting a friend's startup down the street and ending up in a
conversation with one of their investors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question
of whether to take outside investment.</span> <span class="s s100">The question is not whether
you need it, but whether it brings any advantage at all.</span>
<span class="s s101">Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors
an advantage over you if they do it and you don't.</span> <span class="s s102">So if you hear
someone saying "we don't need to be in Silicon Valley," that use
of the word "need" is a sign they're not even thinking about the
question right.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing
cheapness of starting a startup means the particles they're attracting
are getting lighter.</span> <span class="s s104">A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year
old guys.</span> <span class="s s105">A company like that can move much more easily than one
with 10 people, half of whom have kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn't
seem to be a problem.</span> <span class="s s107">The advantage of being able to work together
face to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving.</span>
<span class="s s108">Ask anyone who's done it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a
national business.</span> <span class="s s110">One of the most common emails we get is from
people asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator.</span>
<span class="s s111">But this just wouldn't work.</span> <span class="s s112">Seed funding isn't regional, just as
big research universities aren't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">Is seed funding not merely national, but international?</span> <span class="s s114">Interesting
question.</span> <span class="s s115">There are signs it may be.</span> <span class="s s116">We've had an ongoing
stream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to do
particularly well, because they're all people who were so determined
to succeed that they were willing to move to another country to do
it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new 
silicon valleys.</span> <span class="s s118">If startups are mobile, the best local talent 
will go to the real Silicon Valley,
and all they'll get at the local one will be the people who didn't
have the energy to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally. It's cities that
compete, not countries. Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s120">7. Better Judgement Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="s s121">If the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people
whose job is to judge them are going to have to get better at
it.</span> <span class="s s122">I'm thinking particularly of investors and acquirers.</span> <span class="s s123">We now
get on the order of 1000 applications a year.</span> <span class="s s124">What are we going
to do if we get 10,000?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">That's actually an alarming idea.</span> <span class="s s126">But we'll figure out some kind
of answer.</span> <span class="s s127">We'll have to.</span> <span class="s s128">It will probably involve writing some
software, but fortunately we can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s129">Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.</span> 
<span class="s s130">They generally do better than investors, because they pick
later, when there's more performance to measure.</span> <span class="s s131">But even at the
most advanced acquirers, identifying companies to
buy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition often
involves a great deal of unneccessary friction.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers
who will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen.</span>
<span class="s s133">At the moment those two functions are separate.</span> <span class="s s134">Promising new
startups are often discovered by developers.</span> <span class="s s135">If someone powerful
enough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys
to negotiate.</span> <span class="s s136">It would be better if both were combined in
one group, headed by someone with a technical background and some
vision of what they wanted to accomplish.</span> <span class="s s137">Maybe in the future big
companies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible for
technology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringing
technology in from outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s138">At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in
trouble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they could
have bought earlier for $20 million.</span> <span class="s s139">There should start to be
someone who gets in trouble for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s140">8. College Will Change</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">If the best hackers start their own companies after college
instead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college.</span>
<span class="s s142">Most of these changes will be for the better.</span> <span class="s s143">I think the experience
of college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward
you'll be judged by potential employers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">One change will be in the meaning of "after
college," which will switch from when one graduates from college
to when one leaves it.</span> <span class="s s145">If you're starting your own company, why
do you need a degree?</span> <span class="s s146">We don't encourage people to start startups
during college, but the best founders are certainly
capable of it.</span> <span class="s s147">Some of the most successful companies we've funded
were started by undergrads.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s148">I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important,
so I'm alarmed to be saying things like this, but there's nothing
magical about a degree.</span> <span class="s s149">There's nothing that magically changes
after you take that last exam.</span> <span class="s s150">The importance of degrees is due
solely to the administrative needs of large organizations.</span> <span class="s s151">These
can certainly affect your life&mdash;it's hard to get into grad
school, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate
degree&mdash;but tests like this will matter less and
less.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s152">As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will
also start to matter less where they go to college.</span> <span class="s s153">In a startup
you're judged by users, and they don't care where you went to
college.</span> <span class="s s154">So in a world of startups, elite universities will play
less of a role as gatekeepers.</span> <span class="s s155">In the US it's a national scandal
how easily children of rich parents game college admissions.</span>
<span class="s s156">But the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by
reforming the universities but by going around them.</span> <span class="s s157">We in the
technology world are used to that sort of solution: you don't beat
the incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s158">The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhaps
even the classes so much as the people you meet.</span> <span class="s s159">If
it becomes common to start a startup after college, students may start
trying to maximize this.</span> <span class="s s160">Instead of focusing on getting
internships at companies they want to work for, they may start
to focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">What students do in their classes will change too.</span> <span class="s s162">Instead of
trying to get good grades to impress future employers, students
will try to learn things.</span> <span class="s s163">We're talking about some pretty dramatic
changes here.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s164">9. Lots of Competitors</span></p>
<p><span class="s s165">If it gets easier to start a startup, it's easier for competitors too.</span> 
<span class="s s166">That doesn't erase the advantage of
increased cheapness, however.</span> <span class="s s167">You're not all playing a zero-sum
game.</span> <span class="s s168">There's not some fixed number of startups that can succeed,
regardless of how many are started.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">In fact, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups
that could succeed.</span> <span class="s s170">Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is
the satisfaction of people's desires.</span> <span class="s s171">And people's desires seem
to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won't
be able to sit on a good idea.</span> <span class="s s173">Other people have your idea, and
they'll be increasingly likely to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">10. Faster Advances</span></p>
<p><span class="s s175">There's a good side to that, at least for consumers of
technology.</span> <span class="s s176">If people get right to work implementing ideas instead
of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s177">Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like the
punctuated equilibrium model of evolution.</span> <span class="s s178">There are some kinds
of ideas that are so threatening that it's hard for big companies
even to think of them.</span> <span class="s s179">Look at what a hard time Microsoft is
having discovering web apps.</span> <span class="s s180">They're like a character in a movie
that everyone in the audience can see something bad is about to
happen to, but who can't see it himself.</span> <span class="s s181">The big innovations
that happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster if
the rate of new companies increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">But in fact there will be a double speed increase.</span> <span class="s s183">People won't
wait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas will
increasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies.</span>
<span class="s s184">Which means technology will evolve faster per company as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s185">Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast.</span>
<span class="s s186">I talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired by
a big company.</span> <span class="s s187">He was a precise sort of guy, so he'd measured their
productivity before and after.</span> <span class="s s188">He counted lines of code, which can
be a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it
was the same group of programmers.</span> <span class="s s189">He found they were one thirteenth
as productive after the acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s190">The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one.</span>
<span class="s s191">I think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness.</span> <span class="s s192">I
experienced this myself, and his number sounds about right.</span> <span class="s s193">There's
something about big companies that just sucks the energy out of
you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s194">Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.</span> <span class="s s195">There
is an enormous latent capacity in the world's hackers that most
people don't even realize is there.</span> <span class="s s196">That's the main reason we do
Y Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy for
hackers to start their own startups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s197">A Series of Tubes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">The process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing in
an old house.</span> <span class="s s199">The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks
in every joint.</span> <span class="s s200">In the future this mess will gradually be replaced
by a single, huge pipe.</span> <span class="s s201">The water will still have to get from A
to B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying
out through some random leak.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s202">This will change a lot of things for the better.</span> <span class="s s203">In a big, straight
pipe like that, the force of being measured by one's performance
will propagate back through the whole system.</span> <span class="s s204">Performance is always
the ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now
that most people are insulated from it most of the time.</span> <span class="s s205">So you
end up with a world in which high school students think they need
to get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students
think they need to get good grades to impress employers, within
which the employees waste most of their time in political battles,
and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so
few choices.</span> <span class="s s206">Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe.</span>
<span class="s s207">Then the effects of being measured by performance would propagate
all the way back to high school, flushing out all the arbitrary
stuff people are measured by now.</span> <span class="s s208">That is the future of web startups.</span></p>
