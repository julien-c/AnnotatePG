  <h2><span class="s s1">How to Be an Angel Investor</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">March 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a talk at AngelConf.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I'd do some angel
investing.</span> <span class="s s5">Seven years later I still hadn't started.</span> <span class="s s6">I put it off
because it seemed mysterious and complicated.</span> <span class="s s7">It turns out to be 
easier than I expected, and also more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really
isn't.</span> <span class="s s9">You give a startup money and they give you stock.</span> <span class="s s10">You'll
probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra
rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible
debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and
the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding
round.</span> 
<span class="s s11">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the
other.</span> <span class="s s13">The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.</span> <span class="s s14">But really
it doesn't matter much which you use.</span> <span class="s s15">Don't spend much time worrying
about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start
angel investing.</span> <span class="s s16">That's not how you win at this game.</span> <span class="s s17">When you
hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not
saying "He got a 4x liquidation preference.</span><span class="s s18">"</span> <span class="s s19">They're saying "He
invested in Google.</span><span class="s s20">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">That's how you win: by investing in the right startups.</span> <span class="s s22">That is
so much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading
you by even talking about other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">Mechanics</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together
to invest on the same terms. In a syndicate there is usually a
"lead" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.</span> <span class="s s25">But not
always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of
investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer
supplies the paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a
friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.</span>
<span class="s s27">Then all you have to do is write checks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.</span> <span class="s s29">It's not that
hard to do it yourself.</span> <span class="s s30">You can just use the standard 
series AA
documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.</span>
<span class="s s31">You should of course have your lawyer review everything.</span> <span class="s s32">Both you
and the startup should have lawyers.</span> <span class="s s33">But the lawyers don't have
to create the agreement from scratch.</span> 
<span class="s s34">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you
care about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of
the company.</span> <span class="s s36">The valuation determines how much stock you get.</span> <span class="s s37">If
you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1
million, then the post-money valuation is $1.</span><span class="s s38">05 million, and you
get .</span><span class="s s39">05/1.</span><span class="s s40">05, or 4.</span><span class="s s41">76% of the company's stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take
a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just
as you did.</span> <span class="s s43">If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to
a new investor, your 4.</span><span class="s s44">76% will be reduced to 4.</span><span class="s s45">28%.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">That's ok.</span> <span class="s s47">Dilution is normal.</span> <span class="s s48">What saves you from being mistreated
in future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the
founders.</span> <span class="s s49">They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just
as much.</span> <span class="s s50">And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up 
net ahead.</span> <span class="s s51">So in theory, each further 
round of investment leaves you
with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after
several more rounds you end up with .</span><span class="s s52">5% of the company at the point
where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has
become $5 million.</span> 
<span class="s s53">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that 
let you contribute to
future rounds to maintain your percentage.</span> <span class="s s55">So it's your choice
whether you get diluted.</span> 
<span class="s s56">[4]
If the company does really well,
you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so
high it's not worth it for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">How much does an angel invest?</span> <span class="s s58">That varies enormously, from $10,000
to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.</span> <span class="s s59">The upper
bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.</span>
<span class="s s60">The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever
is greater.</span> <span class="s s61">A typical angel round these days might be $150,000
raised from 5 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">Valuations don't vary as much.</span> <span class="s s63">For angel rounds it's rare to see
a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.</span>
<span class="s s64">4 million is starting to be VC territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">How do you decide what valuation to offer?</span> <span class="s s66">If you're part of a
round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.</span> <span class="s s67">But
what if you're investing by yourself?</span> <span class="s s68">There's no real answer.</span>
<span class="s s69">There is no rational way to value an early stage startup.</span> <span class="s s70">The
valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's
bargaining position.</span> <span class="s s71">If they really want you, either because they
desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot,
they'll let you invest at a low valuation.</span> <span class="s s72">If they don't need you,
it will be higher.</span> <span class="s s73">So guess.</span> <span class="s s74">The startup may not have any more
idea what the number should be than you do.</span> 
<span class="s s75">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">Ultimately it doesn't matter much.</span> <span class="s s77">When angels make a lot of money
from a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.</span><span class="s s78">5
million instead of $3 million.</span> <span class="s s79">It's because the company was really
successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">I can't emphasize that too much.</span> <span class="s s81">Don't get hung up on mechanics
or deal terms. What you should spend your time thinking about is
whether the company is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal
terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the
company good.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how
much you're expected to help the startup.</span> <span class="s s84">Like the amount you
invest, this can vary a lot.</span> <span class="s s85">You don't have to do anything if you
don't want to; you could simply be a source of money.</span> <span class="s s86">Or you can
become a de facto employee of the company.</span> <span class="s s87">Just make sure that you
and the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you'll do
for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels.</span> <span class="s s89">The
ones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,
and only take money from people who are famous and/or will work
hard for them.</span> <span class="s s90">But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of
time or you won't get to invest in any good startups.</span> <span class="s s91">There is a
surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is
and how well it ends up doing.</span> <span class="s s92">Lots of hot startups will end up
failing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.</span>
<span class="s s93">And the latter are so desperate for money that they'll take it from
anyone at a low valuation.</span> 
<span class="s s94">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">Picking Winners</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it?</span> <span class="s s97">The
part of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking
the right companies, is also the hardest.</span> <span class="s s98">So you should practically
ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything
I've told you so far.</span> <span class="s s99">You may need to refer to it at some point,
but it is not the central issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s100">The central issue is picking the right startups.</span> <span class="s s101">What "Make something
people want" is for startups, "Pick the right startups" is for
investors.</span> <span class="s s102">Combined they yield "Pick the startups that will make
something people want.</span><span class="s s103">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s104">How do you do that?</span> <span class="s s105">It's not as simple as picking startups that
are already making something wildly popular.</span> <span class="s s106">By then it's
too late for angels.</span> <span class="s s107">VCs will already be onto them.</span> <span class="s s108">As an angel,
you have to pick startups before they've got a hit&mdash;either
because they've made something great but users don't realize it
yet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration
or two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making
software for transferring money between PDAs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.</span>
<span class="s s110">That's what it comes down to.</span> <span class="s s111">VCs can be fast followers.</span> <span class="s s112">Most of
them don't try to predict what will win.</span> <span class="s s113">They just try to notice
quickly when something already is winning.</span> <span class="s s114">But angels have to be
able to predict.</span> 
<span class="s s115">[7]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s116">One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot
of people out there who have never even made an angel investment
and yet are already better angel investors than they realize.</span>
<span class="s s117">Someone who doesn't know the first thing about the mechanics of
venture funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks
like is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside
out, but thinks 
"hacker" means someone who breaks into computers.</span>
<span class="s s118">If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with
them&mdash;if you both resonate at the same frequency&mdash;then
you may already be a better startup picker than the median professional
VC.</span> 
<span class="s s119">[8]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s120">Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year
after me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking
startups.</span> <span class="s s121">My extra year of experience was rounding error compared
to our ability to empathize with founders.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">What makes a good founder?</span> <span class="s s123">If there were a word that meant the
opposite of hapless, that would be the one.</span> <span class="s s124">Bad founders seem
hapless.</span> <span class="s s125">They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm
them and they get discouraged and give up.</span> <span class="s s126">Good founders make
things happen the way they want.</span> <span class="s s127">Which is not to say they force
things to happen in a predefined way.</span> <span class="s s128">Good founders have a healthy
respect for reality.</span> <span class="s s129">But they are relentlessly resourceful.</span> <span class="s s130">That's
the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.</span> <span class="s s131">You want to fund
people who are relentlessly resourceful.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">Notice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking
about people.</span> <span class="s s133">There is an ongoing debate between investors which
is more important, the people, or the idea&mdash;or more precisely,
the market.</span> <span class="s s134">Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the people&mdash;that
the idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the
company.</span> <span class="s s135">Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok founders in a
hot market over great founders in a bad one.</span> 
<span class="s s136">[9]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s137">These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good
people find good markets.</span> <span class="s s138">Bill Gates would probably have ended up
pretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to drop the PC standard in
his lap.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">I've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who
prefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.</span>
<span class="s s140">It's kind of surprising that it even exists.</span> <span class="s s141">You'd expect opinions
to have converged more.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">But I think I've figured out what's going on.</span> <span class="s s143">The three most
prominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,
and Joe Kraus.</span> <span class="s s144">And all three of them, in their own startups,
basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast
that it was all they could do to keep up with it.</span> <span class="s s145">That kind of
experience is hard to ignore.</span> <span class="s s146">Plus I think they underestimate
themselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge
thermal upward, and they think "anyone could have done it.</span><span class="s s147">"</span> <span class="s s148">But
that isn't true; they are not ordinary people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s149">So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and
bet on people.</span> <span class="s s150">Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict
them&mdash;not even the founders, and certainly not you as an
investor.</span> <span class="s s151">And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit
them anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s152">Deal Flow</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you
have startups to choose between.</span> <span class="s s154">How do you find them?</span> <span class="s s155">This is
yet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates.</span> <span class="s s156">If you
tag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s157">The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream
of reasonably high quality ones.</span> <span class="s s158">The traditional way to do this
is through contacts.</span> <span class="s s159">If you're friends with a lot of investors and
founders, they'll send deals your way.</span> <span class="s s160">The Valley basically runs
on referrals.</span> <span class="s s161">And once you start to become known as reliable,
useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.</span> <span class="s s162">I certainly
will.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s163">There's also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to
events like Y Combinator's Demo Day, where a batch of newly created
startups presents to investors all at once.</span> <span class="s s164">We have two Demo Days
a year, one in March and one in August.</span> <span class="s s165">These are basically mass
referrals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s166">But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches
between startups and investors.</span> <span class="s s167">The personal referral is still the
most common route.</span> <span class="s s168">So if you want to hear about new startups, the
best way to do it is to get lots of referrals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups.</span> <span class="s s170">No
matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to
send you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a couple
investments.</span> <span class="s s171">Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,
high-maintenance investors.</span> <span class="s s172">But once you prove yourself as a good
investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in
both quality and quantity.</span> <span class="s s173">At the extreme, for someone like Ron
Conway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole
Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to
bootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor
in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a
chain reaction.</span> <span class="s s175">Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.</span>
<span class="s s176">There probably aren't more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole
Valley, and yet they're probably the single most important ingredient
in making the Valley what it is.</span> <span class="s s177">Angels are the limiting reagent
in startup formation.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, 
then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline
for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider.</span> <span class="s s179">That is kind
of mind-blowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">Being Good</span></p>
<p><span class="s s181">How do you be a good angel investor?</span> <span class="s s182">The first thing you need is
to be decisive.</span> <span class="s s183">When we talk to founders about good and bad
investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say "he
writes checks.</span><span class="s s184">"</span> <span class="s s185">That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone.</span>
<span class="s s186">Far from it.</span> <span class="s s187">It means he makes up his mind quickly,
and follows through.</span> <span class="s s188">You may be thinking, how hard could that be?</span>
<span class="s s189">You'll see when you try it.</span> <span class="s s190">It follows from the nature of angel
investing that the decisions are hard.</span> <span class="s s191">You have to guess early,
at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,
because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded
them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">Suppose it's 1998.</span> <span class="s s193">You come across a startup founded by a couple
grad students.</span> <span class="s s194">They say they're going to work on Internet search.</span>
<span class="s s195">There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.</span>
<span class="s s196">How can these grad students possibly compete with them?</span> <span class="s s197">And does
search even matter anyway?</span> <span class="s s198">All the search engines are trying to
get people to start calling them "portals" instead.</span> <span class="s s199">Why would you
want to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are
trying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they
themselves have declared passe?</span> <span class="s s200">And yet the grad students seem
pretty smart.</span> <span class="s s201">What do you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s202">There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet
down the size of your investment till it's an amount you wouldn't
care too much about losing.</span> <span class="s s203">For every rich person (you probably
shouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)
there's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to
lose.</span> <span class="s s204">Till you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than
that per startup.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s205">For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would
probably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000.</span> <span class="s s206">That's
less than .</span><span class="s s207">3% of your net worth.</span> <span class="s s208">So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000
investments.</span> <span class="s s209">Nothing will teach you about angel investing like
experience.</span> <span class="s s210">Treat the first few as an educational expense.</span> <span class="s s211">$60,000
is less than a lot of graduate programs. Plus you get equity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s212">What's really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string
founders along while trying to gather more information about the
startup's trajectory.</span> 
<span class="s s213">[10]
 There's always a temptation to do that,
because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously
resist it.</span> <span class="s s214">In the long term it's to your advantage to be good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s215">The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be
a good person.</span> <span class="s s216">Angel investing is not a business where you make
money by screwing people over.</span> <span class="s s217">Startups create wealth, and
creating wealth is not a zero sum game.</span> <span class="s s218">No one has to lose for you
to win.</span> <span class="s s219">In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they'll
just get demoralized and the company will do worse.</span> <span class="s s220">Plus your
referrals will dry up.</span> <span class="s s221">So I recommend being good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s222">The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good
people.</span> <span class="s s223">Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help
it.</span> <span class="s s224">And they'll help people they haven't invested in too.</span> <span class="s s225">When
they do favors they don't seem to keep track of them.</span> <span class="s s226">It's too
much overhead.</span> <span class="s s227">They just try to help everyone, and assume good
things will flow back to them somehow.</span> <span class="s s228">Empirically that seems to
work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s229">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s230">[1]
Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation,
or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out
to be when it converts.</span> <span class="s s231">E.</span><span class="s s232">g.</span> <span class="s s233">convertible debt at a discount of 30%
means when it converts you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30%
lower valuation.</span> <span class="s s234">That can be useful in cases where you can't or
don't want to figure out what the valuation should be.</span> <span class="s s235">You leave
it to the next investor.</span> <span class="s s236">On the other hand, a lot of investors
want to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do
convertible debt with a cap.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s237">[2]
The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is
not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred
dollars an hour over the details.</span> <span class="s s238">That's why the series AA paperwork
aims at a middle ground.</span> <span class="s s239">You can just start from the compromise
you'd have reached after lots of back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s240">When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists
in startups.</span> <span class="s s241">Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this.</span> <span class="s s242">Their
inexperience makes them overbuild: they'll create huge, overcomplicated
agreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s243">In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick,
Fenwick &amp; West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward.</span> <span class="s s244">In Boston
the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s245">[3]
Your mileage may vary.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s246">[4]
These anti-dilution provisions also protect you against
tricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing
another round that values the company at $1.</span> <span class="s s247">If you have a competent
startup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected
against such tricks initially.</span> <span class="s s248">But it could become a problem later.</span>
<span class="s s249">If a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may
try to make you take out your anti-dilution protections.</span> <span class="s s250">And if
they do the startup will be pressuring you to agree.</span> <span class="s s251">They'll tell
you that if you don't, you're going to kill their deal with the VC.</span>
<span class="s s252">I recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen's agreement
with the founders: agree with them in advance that you're not going
to give up your anti-dilution protections.</span> <span class="s s253">Then it's up to them
to tell VCs early on.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s254">The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario.</span>
<span class="s s255">The VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional
funding at a pre-money valuation of zero.</span> <span class="s s256">This wipes out the
existing shareholders, including both you and the founders.</span> <span class="s s257">They
then grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to
stay around, but you get nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s258">Obviously this is not a nice thing to do.</span> <span class="s s259">It doesn't happen often.</span>
<span class="s s260">Brand-name VCs wouldn't recapitalize a company just to steal a few
percent from an angel.</span> <span class="s s261">But there's a continuum here.</span> <span class="s s262">A less
upstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big
chunk of stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s263">I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your
anti-dilution protections.</span> <span class="s s264">Everything is a negotiation.</span> <span class="s s265">If you're
part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal
protections and rely on social ones.</span> <span class="s s266">If you invest in a deal led
by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well
protected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice
before crossing him.</span> <span class="s s267">This kind of protection is one of the reasons
angels like to invest in syndicates.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s268">[5]
Don't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you
end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're
sure your money will be the last they ever need.</span> <span class="s s269">Later stage
investors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have
enough equity left to motivate them.</span> <span class="s s270">I talked to a VC recently who
said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned
them down because investors already owned more than half of it.</span>
<span class="s s271">Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting
such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were
shooting themselves in the foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s272">[6]
At any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I
believe will be big successes but who are running on vapor,
financially, because investors don't yet get what they're doing.</span>
<span class="s s273">(And no, unfortunately, I can't tell you who they are.</span> <span class="s s274">I can't
refer a startup to an investor I don't know.</span><span class="s s275">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s276">[7]
There are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting. Not
surprisingly, these are the most successful ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s277">[8]
It's somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the
median VC loses money.</span> <span class="s s278">That's one of the most surprising things
I've learned about VC while working on Y Combinator.</span> <span class="s s279">Only a fraction
of VCs even have positive returns.</span> <span class="s s280">The rest exist to satisfy demand
among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class.</span> <span class="s s281">Learning
this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we
were working on Viaweb.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s282">[9]
VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great
people.</span> <span class="s s283">But what they're really saying is they want both.</span> <span class="s s284">They're
so selective that they only even consider great people.</span> <span class="s s285">So when
they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's
how they choose between great people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s286">[10]
Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's
interested in investing but doesn't want to lead.</span> <span class="s s287">There are
circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often
than not what it means is "No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal,
I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes.</span><span class="s s288">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s289">If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it.
Just use the standard series 
AA terms and write them a check.</span></p>
