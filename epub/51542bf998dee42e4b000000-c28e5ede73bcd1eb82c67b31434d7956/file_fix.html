<p>
<span class="s s2">Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming
languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it
fixes.</span> <span class="s s3">The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be
described this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">
Algol: Assembly language is too low-level.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">Pascal: Algol doesn't have enough data types.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Modula: Pascal is too wimpy for systems programming.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">
Simula: Algol isn't good enough at simulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">Smalltalk: Not everything in Simula is an object.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">Fortran: Assembly language is too low-level.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">Cobol: Fortran is scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">PL/1: Fortran doesn't have enough data types.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">Ada: Every existing language is missing something.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">Basic: Fortran is scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">APL: Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">J: APL requires its own character set.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">C: Assemby language is too low-level.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">C++: C is too low-level.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">Java: C++ is a kludge. And Microsoft is going to crush us.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">C#: Java is controlled by Sun.
</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">Lisp: Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">Scheme: MacLisp is a kludge.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">T: Scheme has no libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">Common Lisp: There are too many dialects of Lisp.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Dylan: Scheme has no libraries, and Lisp syntax is scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">
Perl: Shell scripts/awk/sed are not enough like programming languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">Python: Perl is a kludge.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">Ruby: Perl is a kludge, and Lisp syntax is scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">Prolog: Programming is not enough like logic.</span></p>
