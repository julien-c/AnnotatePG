April 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.</span> <span class="s s4">The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.</span> <span class="s s6">It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.</span> <span class="s s8">If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.</span> <span class="s s9">Each year.</span> <span class="s s10">They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.</span> <span class="s s12">In fact they'd cause there to be 
more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup.</span> <span class="s s14">But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.</span> <span class="s s15">Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.</span> <span class="s s16">The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">How would the government decide who's a startup investor?</span> <span class="s s18">The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas.</span> <span class="s s19">We'll establish our own accreditation procedure.</span> <span class="s s20">We know who one another are.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.</span> <span class="s s22">I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.</span> <span class="s s23">The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jeff Clavier, David Hornik, Jessica Livingston, Greg Mcadoo, Aydin Senkut, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.</span></p>
