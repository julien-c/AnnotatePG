  <h2><span class="s s1">If Lisp is So Great</span></h2>
<div><div><span class="s s2">May 2003If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it?</span> <span class="s s3">I was 
asked this question by a student in the audience at a 
talk I gave recently.</span> <span class="s s4">Not for the first time, either.</span><span class="s s5">In languages, as in so many things, there's not much 
correlation between popularity and quality.</span> <span class="s s6">Why does 
John Grisham (King of Torts sales rank, 44) outsell
Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice sales rank, 6191)?</span>
<span class="s s7">Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better
writer?</span><span class="s s8">Here's the first sentence of Pride and Prejudice:
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man 
in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
wife.</span>
<span class="s s9">"It is a truth universally acknowledged?</span><span class="s s10">"</span> <span class="s s11">Long words for
the first sentence of a love story.</span><span class="s s12">Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard.</span> <span class="s s13">Its syntax, or lack
of syntax, makes it look completely unlike 
the languages
most people are used to.</span> <span class="s s14">Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid
of it too.</span> <span class="s s15">I recently came across a notebook from 1983
in which I'd written:
I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.</span>
<span class="s s16">Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning
new things.</span> <span class="s s17">I was so ignorant that learning
almost anything meant learning new things.</span><span class="s s18">People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not
using it.</span> <span class="s s19">The standard
excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp
was too slow.</span> <span class="s s20">Now that Lisp dialects are among
the faster
languages available, that excuse has gone away.</span>
<span class="s s21">Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages
are more popular.</span><span class="s s22">(Beware of such reasoning.</span> <span class="s s23">It gets you Windows.</span><span class="s s24">)Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it's especially
so in programming languages.</span> <span class="s s25">More libraries
get written for popular languages, which makes them still
more popular.</span> <span class="s s26">Programs often have to work with existing programs,
and this is easier if they're written in the same language,
so languages spread from program to program like a virus.</span>
<span class="s s27">And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them 
more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.</span><span class="s s28">Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent,
there would be little justification for using any but the most
popular.</span> <span class="s s29">But they aren't all equivalent, not by a long
shot.</span> <span class="s s30">And that's why less popular languages, like Jane Austen's 
novels, continue to survive at all.</span> <span class="s s31">When everyone else is reading 
the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people 
reading Jane Austen instead.</span></div></div>
