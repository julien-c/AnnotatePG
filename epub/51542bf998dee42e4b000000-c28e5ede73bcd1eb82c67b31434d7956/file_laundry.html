<span class="s s3">As E.</span> <span class="s s4">B.</span> <span class="s s5">White said, "good writing is rewriting.</span><span class="s s6">"</span> <span class="s s7">I didn't
realize this when I was in school.</span> <span class="s s8">In writing, as in math and 
science, they only show you the finished product.</span>
<span class="s s9">You don't see all the false starts.</span> <span class="s s10">This gives students a
misleading view of how things get made.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want 
people to see their mistakes.</span> <span class="s s12">But I'm willing to let people
see an early draft if it will show how much you have
to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">Below is the oldest version I can find of
The Age of the Essay 
(probably the second or third day), with
text that ultimately survived in 
red and text that later
got deleted in gray.</span>
<span class="s s14">There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong,
things that seem like bragging, flames,
digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">I discarded more from the beginning.</span> <span class="s s16">That's
not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.</span> <span class="s s17">There
are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where
I'm heading.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">The amount of cutting is about average. I probably write
three to four words for every one that appears in the final
version of an essay.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">(Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, remember
that anything you see here that's not in the final version is obviously
something I chose not to publish, often because I disagree
with it.</span><span class="s s20">)</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s21">Recently a friend said that what he liked about
my essays was that they weren't written the way
we'd been taught to write essays in school.</span> <span class="s s22">You
remember: topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.</span> <span class="s s23">It hadn't
occurred to me till then that those horrible things
we had to write in school were even connected to
what I was doing now.</span> <span class="s s24">But sure enough, I thought,
they did call them "essays," didn't they?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Well, they're not.</span> <span class="s s26">Those things you have to write
in school are not only not essays, they're one of the
most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have
to jump through in school.</span> <span class="s s27">And I worry that they
not only teach students the wrong things about writing,
but put them off writing entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what
an essay really is, and how you write one.</span> <span class="s s29">Or at least,
how I write one.</span> <span class="s s30">Students be forewarned: if you actually write
the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad
grades.</span> <span class="s s31">But knowing how it's really done should
at least help you to understand the feeling of futility
you have when you're writing the things they tell you to.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s32">The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.</span>
<span class="s s33">It's a fine thing for schools to
teach students how to
write.</span> <span class="s s34">But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre
reason that I'll explain in a moment),
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.</span> <span class="s s35">And so all over the country, students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget 
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">With obvious 
results.</span> <span class="s s37">Only a few people really
care about
symbolism in Dickens.</span> <span class="s s38">The teacher doesn't.</span>
<span class="s s39">The students don't.</span> <span class="s s40">Most of the people who've had to write PhD
disserations about Dickens don't.</span> <span class="s s41">And certainly
Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">How did things get this way?</span> <span class="s s43">To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.</span> <span class="s s44">Between about 500 and 1000, life was
not very good in Europe.</span> <span class="s s45">The term "dark ages" is presently
out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn't dark; 
it was just different), but if this label didn't already
exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor.</span> <span class="s s46">What little
original thought there was took place in lulls between
constant wars and had something of the character of
the thoughts of parents with a new baby.</span>
<span class="s s47">The most amusing thing written during this
period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is,
I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s48">Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath.</span>
<span class="s s49">And once they
had the luxury of curiosity, one of the first things they discovered
was what we call "the classics.</span><span class="s s50">"</span>
<span class="s s51">Imagine if we were visited 
by aliens.</span> <span class="s s52">If they could even get here they'd presumably know a
few things we don't.</span> <span class="s s53">Immediately Alien Studies would become
the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly
discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up
everything they'd discovered.</span> <span class="s s54">So it was in Europe in 1200.</span>
<span class="s s55">When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained
not just new answers, but new questions.</span> <span class="s s56">(If anyone proved
a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there
is no record of it.</span><span class="s s57">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">For a couple centuries, some of the most important work
being done was intellectual archaelogy.</span> <span class="s s59">Those were also
the centuries during which schools were first established.</span>
<span class="s s60">And since reading ancient texts was the essence of what
scholars did then, it became the basis of the curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">By 1700, someone who wanted to learn about
physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek in order to read Aristotle.</span> <span class="s s62">But schools
change slower than scholarship: the study of
ancient texts
had such prestige that it remained the backbone of 
education
until the late 19th century.</span> <span class="s s63">By then it was merely a tradition.</span>
<span class="s s64">It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult,
and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy;
it introduced students to
cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness
made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.</span>
<span class="s s65">But it certainly wasn't
true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that students were
serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">Classical scholarship had also changed.</span> <span class="s s67">In the early era, philology
actually mattered.</span> <span class="s s68">The texts that filtered into Europe were
all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and
copyists.</span> <span class="s s69">Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said
before they could figure out what he meant.</span> <span class="s s70">But by the modern
era such questions were answered as well as they were ever
going to be.</span> <span class="s s71">And so the study of ancient texts became less
about ancientness and more about texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?</span> <span class="s s73">The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.</span>
<span class="s s74">But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.</span>
<span class="s s75">The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
the people studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">And so began the study of modern literature.</span> <span class="s s77">There was some
initial resistance, but it didn't last long.</span>
<span class="s s78">The limiting
reagent in the growth of university departments is what
parents will let undergraduates study.</span> <span class="s s79">If parents will let
their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.</span>
<span class="s s80">There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them.</span>
<span class="s s81">The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish
one another's papers.</span> <span class="s s82">Universities with x departments will
subscribe to the journals.</span> <span class="s s83">Graduate students who want jobs
as professors of x will write dissertations about it.</span> <span class="s s84">It may
take a good long while for the more prestigious universities
to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes, but
at the other end of the scale there are so many universities
competing to attract students that the mere establishment of
a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">High schools imitate universities.</span>
<span class="s s86">And so once university
English departments were established in the late nineteenth century,
the 'riting component of the 3 Rs 
was morphed into English.</span>
<span class="s s87">With the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a
few decades before.</span> <span class="s s88">It's no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.</span>
<span class="s s90">The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, and
that could be taught better by itself.</span> <span class="s s91">Students learn better
when they're interested in what they're doing, and it's hard
to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens.</span>
<span class="s s92">Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionally
are not really interested in it.</span> <span class="s s93">(Though indeed, it's been a
while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're
writing about gender.</span><span class="s s94">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will 
be adopted.</span> <span class="s s96">Public schools probably couldn't stop teaching
English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by
law.</span> <span class="s s97">But here's a related suggestion that goes with the grain
instead of against it: that universities establish a
writing major.</span> <span class="s s98">Many of the students who now major in English
would major in writing if they could, and most would
be better off.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be
exposed to their literary heritage.</span> <span class="s s100">Certainly.</span> <span class="s s101">But is that
more important than that they learn to write well?</span> <span class="s s102">And are
English classes even the place to do it?</span> <span class="s s103">After all,
the average public high school student gets zero exposure to 
his artistic heritage.</span> <span class="s s104">No disaster results.</span>
<span class="s s105">The people who are interested in art learn about it for
themselves, and those who aren't don't.</span> <span class="s s106">I find that American
adults are no better or worse informed about literature than
art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature
in high school and no time at all studying art.</span> <span class="s s107">Which presumably
means that what they're taught in school is rounding error 
compared to what they pick up on their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">Indeed, English classes may even be harmful.</span> <span class="s s109">In my case they
were effectively aversion therapy.</span> <span class="s s110">Want to make someone dislike
a book?</span> <span class="s s111">Force him to read it and write an essay about it.</span>
<span class="s s112">And make the topic so intellectually bogus that you
could not, if asked, explain why one ought to write about it.</span>
<span class="s s113">I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school
I never read the books we were assigned.</span> <span class="s s114">I was so disgusted with
what we were doing that it became a point of honor
with me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students'
without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names
of the characters and a few random events in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s115">I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same
problem there.</span> <span class="s s116">It was not the teachers.</span> <span class="s s117">It was English.</span> 
<span class="s s118">We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them.</span>
<span class="s s119">About what, and why?</span> <span class="s s120">That no one seemed to be able to explain.</span>
<span class="s s121">Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher 
wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken
place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the
subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.</span>
<span class="s s122">One got extra credit for motives having to do with class,
as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and 
sexuality.</span> <span class="s s123">I learned how to churn out such stuff well enough
to get an A, but I never took another English class.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s124">And the books we did these disgusting things to, like those
we mishandled in high school, I find still have black marks
against them in my mind.</span> <span class="s s125">The one saving grace was that 
English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers like
Henry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway.</span>
<span class="s s126">One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether to
allow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn't work.</span>
<span class="s s127">Fields that are intellectually unsure of themselves rely on
a similar principle.</span> <span class="s s128">Reading P.</span><span class="s s129">G.</span> <span class="s s130">Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or
Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like
serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before 
English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him.</span> <span class="s s131">[sh]
And so good writers (just you wait and see who's still in
print in 300 years) are less likely to have readers turned 
against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour guides.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">The other big difference between a real essay and the 
things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't 
take a position and then defend it.</span> <span class="s s133">That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature, 
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.</span> <span class="s s134">It's often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.</span> <span class="s s135">In fact they
were more law schools.</span> <span class="s s136">And at least in our tradition
lawyers are advocates: they are
trained to be able to
take
either side of an argument and make as good a case for it 
as they can.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s138">Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors,
it probably isn't), it tended to pervade
the atmosphere of
early universities.</span> <span class="s s139">After the lecture the most common form
of discussion was the disputation.</span> <span class="s s140">This idea
is at least
nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense-- indeed,
in the very word thesis.</span> <span class="s s141">Most people treat the words 
thesis
and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,
a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">I'm not complaining that we blur these two words together.</span>
<span class="s s143">As far as I'm concerned, the sooner we lose the original
sense of the word thesis, the better.</span> <span class="s s144">For many, perhaps most, 
graduate students, it is stuffing a square peg into a round
hole to try to recast one's work as a single thesis.</span> <span class="s s145">And
as for the disputation, that seems clearly a net lose.</span>
<span class="s s146">Arguing two sides of a case may be a necessary evil in a
legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s147">And yet this principle is built into the very structure of 
the essays
they teach you to write in high school.</span> <span class="s s148">The topic
sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting 
paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
conclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?</span> <span class="s s149">I was never sure 
about that in high school.</span> <span class="s s150">If your thesis was well expressed,
what need was there to restate it?</span> <span class="s s151">In theory it seemed that
the conclusion of a really good essay ought not to need to 
say any more than QED.</span>
<span class="s s152">But when you understand the origins
of this sort of "essay", you can see where the
conclusion comes from.</span> <span class="s s153">It's the concluding remarks to the 
jury.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s154">What other alternative is there?</span> <span class="s s155">To answer that
we have to
reach back into history again, though this time not so far.</span>
<span class="s s156">To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.</span>
<span class="s s157">He was
doing something quite different from what a
lawyer does,
and
the difference is embodied in the name.</span> <span class="s s158">Essayer is the French
verb meaning "to try" (the cousin of our word assay),
and an "essai" is an effort.</span>
<span class="s s159">An essay is something you
write in order
to figure something out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s160">Figure out what?</span> <span class="s s161">You don't know yet.</span> <span class="s s162">And so you can't begin with a
thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have 
one.</span> <span class="s s163">An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a 
question.</span> <span class="s s164">In a real essay, you don't take a position and
defend it.</span> <span class="s s165">You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and
walk in to see what's inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s166">If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need
to write anything, though?</span> <span class="s s167">Why not just sit and think?</span> <span class="s s168">Well,
there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.</span> <span class="s s169">Expressing
ideas helps to form them.</span> <span class="s s170">Indeed, helps is far too weak a
word.</span> <span class="s s171">90%
of what ends up in my essays was stuff
I only
thought of when I sat down to write them.</span> <span class="s s172">That's why I
write them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s173">So there's another difference between essays and
the things
you have to write in school.</span> <span class="s s174">In school
you are, in theory,
explaining yourself to someone else.</span> <span class="s s175">In the best case---if
you're really organized---you're just writing it down.</span>
<span class="s s176">In a real essay you're writing for yourself.</span> <span class="s s177">You're
thinking out loud.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">But not quite.</span> <span class="s s179">Just as inviting people over forces you to
clean up your apartment, writing something that you know
other people will read forces you to think well.</span> <span class="s s180">So it
does matter to have an audience.</span> <span class="s s181">The things I've written
just for myself are no good.</span> <span class="s s182">Indeed, they're bad in
a particular way:
they tend to peter out.</span> <span class="s s183">When I run into
difficulties, I notice that I
tend to conclude with a few vague
questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s184">This seems a common problem.</span>
<span class="s s185">It's practically the standard
ending in blog entries--- with the addition of a "heh" or an 
emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense that
something is missing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s186">And indeed, a lot of
published essays peter out in this
same way.</span>
<span class="s s187">Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.</span> <span class="s s188">Outside writers tend to supply
editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
make a beeline toward a rousing (and
foreordained) conclusion.</span> <span class="s s189">But the staff writers feel
obliged to write something more
balanced, which in
practice ends up meaning blurry.</span>
<span class="s s190">Since they're
writing for a popular magazine, they start with the
most radioactively controversial questions, from which
(because they're writing for a popular magazine)
they then proceed to recoil from
in terror.</span>
<span class="s s191">Gay marriage, for or
against?</span> <span class="s s192">This group says one thing.</span> <span class="s s193">That group says
another.</span> <span class="s s194">One thing is certain: the question is a
complex one.</span> <span class="s s195">(But don't get mad at us.</span> <span class="s s196">We didn't
draw any conclusions.</span><span class="s s197">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">Questions aren't enough.</span> <span class="s s199">An essay has to come up with answers.</span>
<span class="s s200">They don't always, of course.</span> <span class="s s201">Sometimes you start with a 
promising question and get nowhere.</span> <span class="s s202">But those you don't
publish.</span> <span class="s s203">Those are like experiments that get inconclusive
results.</span> <span class="s s204">Something you publish ought to tell the reader 
something he didn't already know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s205">But what you tell him doesn't matter, so long as 
it's interesting.</span> <span class="s s206">I'm sometimes accused of meandering.</span>
<span class="s s207">In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.</span>
<span class="s s208">There you're not concerned with truth.</span> <span class="s s209">You already
know where you're going, and you want to go straight there,
blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
your way across swampy ground.</span> <span class="s s210">But that's not what
you're trying to do in an essay.</span> <span class="s s211">An essay is supposed to
be a search for truth.</span> <span class="s s212">It would be suspicious if it didn't
meander.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">The Meander is a river in Asia Minor (aka
Turkey).</span>
<span class="s s214">As you might expect, it winds all over the place.</span>
<span class="s s215">But does it
do this out of frivolity?</span> <span class="s s216">Quite the opposite.</span>
<span class="s s217">Like all rivers, it's rigorously following the laws of physics.</span>
<span class="s s218">The path it has discovered,
winding as it is, represents
the most economical route to the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">The river's algorithm is simple.</span> <span class="s s220">At each step, flow down.</span>
<span class="s s221">For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.</span>
<span class="s s222">Of all the places to go next, choose
whichever seems
most interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s223">I'm pushing this metaphor a bit.</span> <span class="s s224">An essayist
can't have
quite as little foresight as a river.</span> <span class="s s225">In fact what you do
(or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman
road-builder.</span> <span class="s s226">I have a general idea of the direction
I want to go in, and
I choose the next topic with that in mind.</span> <span class="s s227">This essay is
about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that
direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I
thought I was going to write about writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s228">Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm is
called) can get you in trouble.</span>
<span class="s s229">Sometimes, just
like a river,
you
run up against a blank wall.</span> <span class="s s230">What
I do then is just 
what the river does: backtrack.</span>
<span class="s s231">At one point in this essay
I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
of ideas.</span> <span class="s s232">I had to go back n
paragraphs and start over
in another direction.</span> <span class="s s233">For illustrative purposes I've left
the abandoned branch as a footnote.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s234">Err on the side of the river.</span> <span class="s s235">An essay is not a reference
work.</span> <span class="s s236">It's not something you read looking for a specific
answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.</span> <span class="s s237">I'd much
rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along
a prescribed course.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s238">So what's interesting?</span> <span class="s s239">For me, interesting means surprise.</span>
<span class="s s240">Design, as Matz
has said, should follow the principle of
least surprise.</span>
<span class="s s241">A button that looks like it will make a
machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.</span> <span class="s s242">Essays
should do the opposite.</span> <span class="s s243">Essays should aim for maximum
surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s244">I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel
vicariously.</span> <span class="s s245">When friends came back from faraway places,
it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them about
their trip.</span>
<span class="s s246">I really wanted to know.</span> <span class="s s247">And I found that
the best way to get information out of them was to ask
what surprised them.</span> <span class="s s248">How was the place different from what
they expected?</span> <span class="s s249">This is an extremely useful question.</span>
<span class="s s250">You can ask it of even
the most unobservant people, and it will
extract information they didn't even know they were
recording.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s252">Indeed, you can ask it in real time.</span> <span class="s s253">Now when I go somewhere
new, I make a note of what surprises me about it.</span> <span class="s s254">Sometimes I
even make a conscious effort to visualize the place beforehand,
so I'll have a detailed image to diff with reality.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s255">Surprises are facts
you didn't already 
know.</span>
<span class="s s256">But they're
more than that.</span> <span class="s s257">They're facts
that contradict things you
thought you knew.</span> <span class="s s258">And so they're the most valuable sort of
fact you can get.</span> <span class="s s259">They're like a food that's not merely
healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
you've already eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s260">How do you find surprises?</span> <span class="s s261">Well, therein lies half
the work of essay writing.</span> <span class="s s262">(The other half is expressing
yourself well.</span><span class="s s263">) You can at least
use yourself as a
proxy for the reader.</span> <span class="s s264">You should only write about things
you've thought about a lot.</span> <span class="s s265">And anything you come across
that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot,
will probably surprise most readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s266">For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because
you can only judge computer programmers by working with
them, no one knows in programming who the heroes should
be.</span>
<span class="s s267">I
certainly
didn't realize this when I started writing
the 
essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.</span> <span class="s s268">That's
what you're looking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s269">So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:
you need
a few topics that you think about a lot, and you
need some ability to ferret out the unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s270">What should you think about?</span> <span class="s s271">My guess is that it
doesn't matter.</span> <span class="s s272">Almost everything is
interesting if you get deeply
enough into it.</span> <span class="s s273">The one possible exception
are
things
like working in fast food, which
have deliberately had all
the variation sucked out of them.</span>
<span class="s s274">In retrospect, was there
anything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins?</span>
<span class="s s275">Well, it was interesting to notice
how important color was
to the customers.</span> <span class="s s276">Kids a certain age would point into
the case and say that they wanted yellow.</span> <span class="s s277">Did they want
French Vanilla or Lemon?</span> <span class="s s278">They would just look at you
blankly.</span> <span class="s s279">They wanted yellow.</span> <span class="s s280">And then there was the
mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines n' Cream
was so appealing.</span> <span class="s s281">I'm inclined now to
think it was the salt.</span>
<span class="s s282">And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so disgusting.</span>
<span class="s s283">People would order it because of the name, and were always
disappointed.</span> <span class="s s284">It should have been called In-sink-erator
Fruit.</span>
<span class="s s285">And there was
the difference in the way fathers and
mothers bought ice cream for their kids.</span>
<span class="s s286">Fathers tended to
adopt the attitude of
benevolent kings bestowing largesse,
and mothers that of
harried bureaucrats,
giving in to
pressure against their better judgement.</span>
<span class="s s287">So, yes, there does seem to be material, even in
fast food.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s288">What about the other half, ferreting out the unexpected?</span>
<span class="s s289">That may require some natural ability.</span> <span class="s s290">I've noticed for
a long time that I'm pathologically observant.</span> <span class="s s291">.</span><span class="s s292">.</span><span class="s s293">.</span><span class="s s294">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s295">[That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s296">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s297">[sh] In Shakespeare's own time, serious writing meant theological
discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on the other 
side of the river among the bear gardens and whorehouses.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s298">The other extreme, the work that seems formidable from the moment
it's created (indeed, is deliberately intended to be)
is represented by Milton.</span> <span class="s s299">Like the Aeneid, Paradise Lost is a
rock imitating a butterfly that happened to get fossilized.</span>
<span class="s s300">Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one 
hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography,
and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that "none who read it
ever wished it longer.</span><span class="s s301">"</span></p>
