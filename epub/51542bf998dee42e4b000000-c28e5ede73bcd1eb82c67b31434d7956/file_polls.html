<p><span class="s s2">November 2004</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">
A lot of people are writing now about 
why Kerry lost. Here I want to
examine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so 
wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">In Ohio, which Kerry ultimately
lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory.</span> <span class="s s5">And this wasn't just
random error.</span> <span class="s s6">In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote.</span>
<span class="s s7">In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted
a dead heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">(These are not early numbers.</span> <span class="s s9">They're from about midnight eastern time, 
long after polls closed in Ohio and Florida.</span> <span class="s s10">And yet by the
next afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns.</span> 
<span class="s s11">The only way I can imagine this happening is if those in
charge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actual
returns.</span> <span class="s s12">But that's another issue.</span><span class="s s13">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">What happened?</span> <span class="s s15">The source of the problem may be a variant of
the Bradley Effect.</span> 
<span class="s s16">This term
was invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, 
lost an election for governor of California despite a comfortable
lead in the polls.</span> <span class="s s17">Apparently voters were afraid to say 
they planned to vote against him, lest their motives be
(perhaps correctly) suspected.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">It seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year.</span>
<span class="s s19">In theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.</span> 
<span class="s s20">You're not asking people what they would do.</span> <span class="s s21">You're
asking what they just did.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">How can you get errors asking that?</span> <span class="s s23">Because some people don't
respond.</span> <span class="s s24">To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every
20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.</span> <span class="s s25">But not
everyone wants to answer.</span> <span class="s s26">And the pollsters can't simply ignore
those who won't, or their sample isn't random anymore.</span> <span class="s s27">So what
they do, apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of the
person, and guess from that who they voted for.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">This works so long as there is no correlation between who people
vote for and whether they're willing to talk about it.</span> <span class="s s29">But this
year there may have been.</span> <span class="s s30">It may be that a significant number of 
those who voted for
Bush didn't want to say so.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">Why not?</span> <span class="s s32">Because people in the US are more conservative than they're
willing to admit.</span> <span class="s s33">The values of the elite in this country, at least
at the moment, are NPR values.</span> <span class="s s34">The average person, as I think both
Republicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative.</span> 
<span class="s s35">But while some openly flaunt the fact that they don't share the
opinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous about it, as 
if they had bad table manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">For example, according to current NPR values, you 
can't say anything that might be 
perceived as disparaging towards homosexuals.</span> <span class="s s37">To do 
so is "homophobic.</span><span class="s s38">"</span> <span class="s s39">And yet a large number of Americans are deeply
religious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject of
homosexuality.</span> <span class="s s40">What are they to do?</span> <span class="s s41">I think what many do is keep 
their opinions, but keep them to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">They know what they believe, but they also know what they're supposed
to believe.</span>
<span class="s s43">And so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks
them their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not
always say what they really think.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to
underestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters.</span> <span class="s s45">This seems
to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so 
far off this year.</span> <span class="s s46">NPR values 
said one ought to vote for Kerry.</span> <span class="s s47">So all the people who voted for
Kerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters
they had.</span> <span class="s s48">No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet
defiance.</span></p>
