  <h2><span class="s s1">Apple's Mistake</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p>
<span class="s s2">November 2009I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken.</span> <span class="s s3">Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters
that it's broken.</span><span class="s s4">The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they've ever done.</span> 
<span class="s s5">Their reputation with programmers used to be great.</span>
<span class="s s6">It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.</span>
<span class="s s7">The App Store has changed that.</span> <span class="s s8">Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil.</span><span class="s s9">How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store?</span> <span class="s s10">A third?</span> <span class="s s11">Half?</span> <span class="s s12">And that's just so far.</span>
<span class="s s13">The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.</span><span class="s s14">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">How did Apple get into this mess? Their fundamental problem is
that they don't understand software.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes.</span> <span class="s s17">Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly.</span> <span class="s s18">But this model doesn't work for software.</span> <span class="s s19">It doesn't
work for an intermediary to own the user.</span> <span class="s s20">The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words "software" and "publisher" fit together,
the underlying concepts don't.</span> <span class="s s21">Software isn't like music or books.</span>
<span class="s s22">It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user.</span> <span class="s s23">And yet that's what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher.</span> <span class="s s24">And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones.</span> <span class="s s26">But Apple doesn't
understand that either.</span> <span class="s s27">Their model of product development derives
from hardware.</span> <span class="s s28">They work on something till they think it's finished,
then they release it.</span> <span class="s s29">You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.</span>
<span class="s s30">The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate.</span> <span class="s s31">Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store.</span> <span class="s s33">They would say
that.</span> <span class="s s34">But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology.</span> <span class="s s35">Programmers don't use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.</span> <span class="s s36">They use it because it
yields the best results.</span> <span class="s s37">By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s38">How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in
OS&nbsp;X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had
to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month
and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what
they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App
Store tends to be an old and buggy one.</span> <span class="s s40">One developer told me:</span>
</p><span class="s s41">&nbsp;
 As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked
 applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release
 to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.
 I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is
 "I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store", and it's
 combined with the emotion "Really, it's Apple's fault."
&nbsp;
Another wrote:
&nbsp;
 I believe that they think their approval process helps users by
 ensuring quality. In reality, bugs like ours get through all the
 time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,
 leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.
 Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms
 that have immediate approval processes.
&nbsp;
Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the
complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.
They must hear developers complaining. But partners and suppliers
are always complaining. It would be a bad sign if they weren't;
it would mean you were being too easy on them. Meanwhile the iPhone
is selling better than ever. So why do they need to fix anything?</span><p><span class="s s42">They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because
they make such great hardware.</span> <span class="s s43">I just bought a new 27" iMac a
couple days ago.</span> <span class="s s44">It's fabulous.</span> <span class="s s45">The screen's too shiny, and the
disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't
make yourself care.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.</span>
<span class="s s47">I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a
bad human rights record.</span> <span class="s s48">That was new.</span> <span class="s s49">In the past when I bought
things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.</span> <span class="s s50">Oh boy!</span> <span class="s s51">They make
such great stuff.</span> <span class="s s52">This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.</span> <span class="s s53">They
make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.</span> <span class="s s54">Do I really want
to support this company?</span></p><span class="s s55">&nbsp;* * *&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s56">Should Apple care what people like me think? What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">There are a couple reasons they should care.</span> <span class="s s58">One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.</span> <span class="s s59">If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won't work for you.</span> <span class="s s60">That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.</span> <span class="s s61">Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.</span> <span class="s s62">It seemed like selling out.</span> <span class="s s63">When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side.</span> <span class="s s64">But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.</span> <span class="s s65">It was the
people they never got.</span> <span class="s s66">And you know who got them?</span> <span class="s s67">Google and
Apple.</span> <span class="s s68">If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.</span>
<span class="s s69">And it's largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?</span> <span class="s s71">Partly
because they can afford to be.</span> <span class="s s72">The best programmers can work
wherever they want.</span> <span class="s s73">They don't have to work for a company they
have qualms about.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity.</span> <span class="s s75">An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.</span> <span class="s s76">And it's
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren't the ones that win.</span> <span class="s s77">I think the reason Google embraced "Don't
be evil" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.</span>
<span class="s s78">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">That has worked for Google so far.</span> <span class="s s80">They've become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles.</span> <span class="s s81">With Apple that seems less the case.</span> <span class="s s82">When you
look at the famous 
1984 ad 
now, it's easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.</span>
<span class="s s83">[2]
In fact, if you read the dictator's speech it sounds uncannily like a
prophecy of the App Store.</span>
</p><span class="s s85">&nbsp;
 We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
 pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
 of contradictory and confusing truths.
&nbsp;
The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them
is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you. If
anyone should know this, Apple should. VisiCalc made the Apple II.</span><p><span class="s s86">And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.</span> <span class="s s87">Most
applications&mdash;most startups, probably&mdash;grow out of personal projects.</span>
<span class="s s88">Apple itself did.</span> <span class="s s89">Apple made microcomputers because that's what
Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.</span> <span class="s s90">He couldn't have afforded a
minicomputer.</span> 
<span class="s s91">[3]
 Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters
for little microcomputers because
Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.</span> <span class="s s92">It's a
rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers
have iPhones.</span> <span class="s s94">They may know, because they read it in an article,
that Blackberry has such and such market share.</span> <span class="s s95">But in practice
it's as if RIM didn't exist.</span> <span class="s s96">If they're going to build something,
they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building
an iPhone app.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple
continues to maltreat them.</span> <span class="s s98">They're like someone stuck in an abusive
relationship.</span> <span class="s s99">They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't
leave.</span> <span class="s s100">But they're looking for a way out.</span> <span class="s s101">One wrote:</span>
</p><span class="s s102">&nbsp;
 While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they
 place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop
 applications as I would like. In fact I don't intend to make any
 more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.

&nbsp;
Can anything break this cycle? No device I've seen so far could.
Palm and RIM haven't a hope. The only credible contender is Android.
But Android is an orphan; Google doesn't really care about it, not
the way Apple cares about the iPhone. Apple cares about the iPhone
the way Google cares about search.&nbsp;* * *&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s103">Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?</span> <span class="s s104">It's
a worrying prospect.</span> <span class="s s105">It would be a bummer to have another grim
monoculture like we had in the 1990s.</span> <span class="s s106">In 1995, writing software
for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows
applications.</span> <span class="s s107">Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest
thing that drove us to start building web apps.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.</span>
<span class="s s109">You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.</span> <span class="s s110">If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop
apps for that instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s111">How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?</span>
<span class="s s112">It's unlikely you could make something better designed.</span> <span class="s s113">Apple
leaves no room there.</span> <span class="s s114">So this alternative device probably couldn't
win on general appeal.</span> <span class="s s115">It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s116">One way to appeal to programmers is with software.</span> <span class="s s117">If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds
as development machines&mdash;if handhelds displaced laptops the
way laptops displaced desktops.</span> <span class="s s119">You need more control of a development
machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s120">Could anyone make a device that you'd carry around in your pocket
like a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?</span>
<span class="s s121">It's hard to imagine what it would look like.</span> <span class="s s122">But I've learned
never to say never about technology.</span> <span class="s s123">A phone-sized device that
would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present
standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards
of 1995.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s124">My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with
an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when
traveling.</span> <span class="s s125">If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.</span>
<span class="s s126">That still wouldn't be small enough to carry around everywhere like
a phone, but we're within a factor of 4 or so.</span> <span class="s s127">Surely that gap is
bridgeable.</span> <span class="s s128">In fact, let's make it an
RFS.</span> <span class="s s129">Wanted: 
Woman with hammer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s130">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s131">[1]
When Google adopted "Don't be evil," they were still so small
that no one would have expected them to be, yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">[2]
The dictator in the 1984 ad isn't Microsoft, incidentally;
it's IBM.</span> <span class="s s133">IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days, but
they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">[3]
He couldn't even afford a monitor. That's why the Apple
I used a TV as a monitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s135">[4]
Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the
iPhone SDK.</span> <span class="s s136">The problem is not Apple's products but their policies.</span>
<span class="s s137">Fortunately policies are software; Apple can change them instantly
if they want to.</span> <span class="s s138">Handy that, isn't it?</span></p>
