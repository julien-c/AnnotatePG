  <h2><span class="s s1">How to Lose Time and Money </span></h2>
<div><div><span class="s s2">July 2010When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.</span> <span class="s s3">I
now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:
how not to lose it.</span> <span class="s s4">I knew it was possible to go from rich to
poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.</span> <span class="s s5">But while
I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from
poor to rich, 
I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
to poor.</span> <span class="s s6">Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they
were.</span><span class="s s7">So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.</span> <span class="s s8">If you'd
asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by
spending all their money.</span> <span class="s s9">That's how it happens in books and movies,
because that's the colorful way to do it.</span> <span class="s s10">But in fact the way most
fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through
bad investments.</span><span class="s s11">It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.</span> <span class="s s12">Someone with ordinary
tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of
thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending a lot of
money.</span><span class="s s13">"</span> <span class="s s14">Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a
million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an
eye.</span><span class="s s15">In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms
that making investments doesn't.</span> <span class="s s16">Luxuries seem self-indulgent.</span>
<span class="s s17">And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,
you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads
to trouble.</span> <span class="s s18">Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending
the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.</span> <span class="s s19">Which
is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an
investment.</span><span class="s s20">"</span><span class="s s21">The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business,
because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so
basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you
from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes
fairly counterintuitive.</span><span class="s s22">A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with
time is much the same as with money.</span> <span class="s s23">The most dangerous way to
lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake
work.</span> <span class="s s24">When you spend time having fun, you know you're being
self-indulgent.</span> <span class="s s25">Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.</span> <span class="s s26">If I woke
up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd
feel like something was terribly wrong.</span> <span class="s s27">Just thinking about it
makes me wince.</span> <span class="s s28">I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on
a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.</span><span class="s s29">And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in
front of a TV all day&acirc;&#128;&#148;days at the end of which, if I asked myself
what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,
nothing.</span> <span class="s s30">I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad
as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.</span> <span class="s s31">If
I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into
perdition.</span> <span class="s s32">But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get
nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,
like real work.</span> <span class="s s33">Dealing with email, for example.</span> <span class="s s34">You do it sitting
at a desk.</span> <span class="s s35">It's not fun.</span> <span class="s s36">So it must be work.</span><span class="s s37">With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to
protect you.</span> <span class="s s38">It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,
and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.</span> <span class="s s39">So nature and nurture
combine to make us avoid self-indulgence.</span> <span class="s s40">But the world has gotten
more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors
that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more
virtuous types.</span> <span class="s s41">And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.</span><span class="s s42">Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica
Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</span></div></div>
