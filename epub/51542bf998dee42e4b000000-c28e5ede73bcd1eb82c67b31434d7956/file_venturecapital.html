  <h2><span class="s s1">A Unified Theory of VC Suckage</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">March 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">A couple months ago I got an email from a recruiter asking if I was
interested in being a "technologist in residence" at a new venture
capital fund.</span> <span class="s s4">I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs'
George Bush.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">I considered it for about four seconds. Work for a VC fund? Ick.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visit
Greylock, the famous Boston VCs.</span> <span class="s s7">They were the most arrogant
people I've met in my life.</span> <span class="s s8">And I've met a lot of arrogant people.</span>
<span class="s s9">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">I'm not alone in feeling this way, of course. Even a VC friend of
mine dislikes VCs. "Assholes," he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">But lately I've been learning more about how the VC world works,

and a few days ago it hit me that there's a reason VCs are the way
they are.</span> <span class="s s12">It's not so much that the business attracts jerks, or
even that the power they wield corrupts them.</span> <span class="s s13">The real problem is
the way they're paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">The problem with VC funds is that they're funds.</span> <span class="s s15">Like the
managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage
of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees,
plus a percentage of the gains.</span> <span class="s s16">So they want
the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible.</span>
<span class="s s17">But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing
a lot of money.</span> <span class="s s18">And since one person can only manage so many deals,
each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs
that founders hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds,
and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search.</span> <span class="s s21">[2]
With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">It explains why they steal your ideas.</span> <span class="s s23">Every founder knows that
VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up
investing in them.</span> <span class="s s24">It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when
they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for
a competitor.</span> <span class="s s25">This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive.</span>
<span class="s s26">Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business.</span> <span class="s s27">Either
way it sucks.</span> <span class="s s28">But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the
giant deals they do.</span> <span class="s s29">With so much at stake, they have to be devious.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest
in.</span> <span class="s s31">They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise
you, but so that they can watch you.</span> <span class="s s32">Often they even install a new
CEO.</span> <span class="s s33">Yes, he may have extensive business experience.</span> <span class="s s34">But he's
also their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something 
of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit.</span> <span class="s s35">With
so much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike,
if they realized how damaging they can be.</span> <span class="s s37">VCs don't invest $x
million because that's the amount you need, but because that's the
amount the structure of their business requires them to invest.</span> 
<span class="s s38">Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than 
good.</span> <span class="s s39">Google survived enormous VC funding because it could
legitimately absorb large amounts of money.</span> <span class="s s40">They had to buy a lot
of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web.</span> <span class="s s41">Less
fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around
having meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury
bills, and continue to operate frugally. You just try it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">And of course giant investments mean giant valuations.</span> <span class="s s44">They have
to, or there's not enough stock left to keep the founders interested.</span>
<span class="s s45">You might think a high valuation is a great thing.</span> <span class="s s46">Many founders 
do.</span> <span class="s s47">But you can't eat paper.</span> <span class="s s48">You can't benefit from a high valuation
unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business 

call a "liquidity event," and the higher 
your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that.</span> <span class="s s49">Many a 
founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs
who've just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won't
hear of that.</span> <span class="s s50">You're rolling the dice again, whether you like it
or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single 
round of VC funding.</span> <span class="s s52">This was at the time more than the valuation
of our entire company.</span> <span class="s s53">Was I worried?</span> <span class="s s54">Not at all: I was delighted.</span>
<span class="s s55">It was like watching a car you're chasing turn down a street that
you know has no outlet.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every 
penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us.</span> <span class="s s57">We would have sold.</span>
<span class="s s58">Their investors would have been furious of course.</span> <span class="s s59">But I think the 
main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined
we could be had so cheap.</span> <span class="s s60">They probably assumed we were on the
same VC gravy train they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence.</span> 
<span class="s s62">And that gave us flexibility.</span> <span class="s s63">We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for
$50 million, and everyone was delighted.</span> <span class="s s64">If our competitor had
done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost
money.</span> <span class="s s65">I assume they could have vetoed such a deal.</span> <span class="s s66">But no one 
those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo.</span> <span class="s s67">So unless their
founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo
as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn't
do it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment 
bankers.</span> <span class="s s69">Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs
who'd invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way 
out.</span> <span class="s s70">The only people dumber were retail investors.</span> <span class="s s71">So it was
literally IPO or bust.</span> <span class="s s72">Or rather, IPO then bust, or just bust.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s73">Add up all the evidence of VCs' behavior, and the resulting personality
is not attractive.</span> <span class="s s74">In fact, it's the classic villain: alternately
cowardly, greedy, sneaky, and overbearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">I used to take it for granted that VCs were like this.</span> <span class="s s76">Complaining 
that VCs were jerks used to seem as naive to me as complaining that
users didn't read the reference manual.</span> <span class="s s77">Of course VCs were jerks.</span>
<span class="s s78">How could it be otherwise?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">But I realize now that they're not intrinsically jerks.</span> <span class="s s80">VCs are 
like car salesmen or bureaucrats: the nature of their work
turns them into jerks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">I've met a few VCs I like.</span> <span class="s s82">Mike Moritz seems a good guy.</span> <span class="s s83">He even 
has a sense of humor, which is almost unheard of among VCs.</span> <span class="s s84">From 
what I've read about John Doerr, he sounds like a good guy too, 
almost a hacker.</span> <span class="s s85">But they work for the very best VC funds.</span> <span class="s s86">And 
my theory explains why they'd tend to be different: just as the
very most popular kids don't have to persecute 
nerds, the very best
VCs don't have to act like VCs.</span> <span class="s s87">They get the pick of all the best 
deals.</span> <span class="s s88">So they don't have to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they 
can choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actually
benefit from the giant sums they're compelled to invest.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">VCs often complain that in their business there's too much money
chasing too few deals.</span> <span class="s s90">Few realize that this also describes a flaw
in the way funding works at the level of individual firms.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">Perhaps this was the sort of strategic insight I was supposed to 
come up with as a "technologist in residence.</span><span class="s s92">"</span> <span class="s s93">If so, the good
news is that they're getting it for free.</span> <span class="s s94">The bad news is it
means that if you're not one of the very top funds, you're 
condemned to be the bad guys.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">[1] After Greylock booted founder Philip Greenspun out of ArsDigita,
he wrote a hilarious but also very informative
essay about it.
</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">[2] Since most VCs aren't tech guys, the technology side of their
due diligence tends to be like a body cavity search by someone with
a faulty knowledge of human anatomy.</span> <span class="s s98">After a while we were quite
sore from VCs attempting to probe our nonexistent database orifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">No, we don't use Oracle.</span> <span class="s s100">We just store the data in files.</span> <span class="s s101">Our
secret is to use an OS that doesn't lose our data.</span> <span class="s s102">Which OS?</span>
<span class="s s103">FreeBSD.</span> <span class="s s104">Why do you use that instead of Windows NT?</span> <span class="s s105">Because it's
better and it doesn't cost anything.</span> <span class="s s106">What, you're using a
freeware OS?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s107">How many times that conversation was repeated.
Then when we got to Yahoo, we found they used FreeBSD and stored
their data in files too.</span></p>
