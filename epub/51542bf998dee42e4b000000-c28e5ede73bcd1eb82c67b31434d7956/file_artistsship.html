<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">November 2008</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">One of the differences between big companies and startups is that
big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves
against mistakes.</span> <span class="s s4">A startup walks like a toddler, bashing
into things and falling over all the time.</span> <span class="s s5">A big company is more
deliberate.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of
learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others
like it.</span> <span class="s s7">After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt
and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all
suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting bids.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in
response to disasters they've suffered, or (probably more often)
by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs
for protecting against new types of disasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes.</span> <span class="s s10">The problem
is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the
check itself has a cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">Every check has a cost.</span> <span class="s s12">For example, consider the case of making
suppliers verify their solvency.</span> <span class="s s13">Surely that's mere prudence?</span> <span class="s s14">But
in fact it could have substantial costs.</span> <span class="s s15">There's obviously the
direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check
proofs of the supplier's solvency.</span> <span class="s s16">But the real costs are the ones
you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier,
but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified.</span>
<span class="s s17">Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short
of the threshold for solvency&mdash;which will of course have been set
on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check,
they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost.</span> <span class="s s19">No
matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would
at least remind everyone there had to be a cost, and send them
looking for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">If companies started doing that, they'd find some surprises.</span> <span class="s s21">Joel
Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to
corporate customers.</span> <span class="s s22">He said that in most companies software costing
up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without
any additional approvals.</span> <span class="s s23">Above that threshold, software purchases
generally had to be approved by a committee.</span> <span class="s s24">But babysitting this
process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make
sense to charge less than $50,000.</span> <span class="s s25">Which means if you're making
something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to
sell it for $50,000 instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company
doesn't waste money.</span> <span class="s s27">And yet the result is that the company pays
10 times as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder
it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost.</span> <span class="s s29">And not
merely linearly, either.</span> <span class="s s30">If you're hard enough to sell to, the
people who are best at making things don't want to bother.</span> <span class="s s31">The
only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in
selling to you.</span> <span class="s s32">Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency.</span>
<span class="s s33">Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers
are no longer in the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all,
governments.</span> <span class="s s35">But checks instituted by governments can cause much
worse problems than merely overpaying.</span> <span class="s s36">Checks instituted by
governments can cripple a country's whole economy.</span> <span class="s s37">Up till about
1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe.</span>
<span class="s s38">One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government
restricted long trading voyages.</span> <span class="s s39">So it was left to the Europeans
to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including
China.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the
US IPO market.</span> <span class="s s41">That wasn't the intention of the legislators who
wrote it.</span> <span class="s s42">They just wanted to add a few more checks on public
companies.</span> <span class="s s43">But they forgot to consider the cost.</span> <span class="s s44">They forgot that
companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that
the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General
Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being
public at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to
ask other interesting questions.</span> <span class="s s46">Is the cost increasing or decreasing?</span>
<span class="s s47">Is it higher in some areas than others?</span> <span class="s s48">Where does it increase
discontinuously?</span> <span class="s s49">If large organizations started to ask questions
like that, they'd learn some frightening things.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.</span> <span class="s s51">The reason
is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies,
and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones
actually prefer to work hard.</span> <span class="s s53">This doesn't seem to be the case in
most types of work.</span> <span class="s s54">When I worked in fast food, we didn't prefer
the busy times.</span> <span class="s s55">And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn't
prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code.</span> <span class="s s57">Or
more precisely, when they release more code.</span> <span class="s s58">Programmers like to
make a difference.</span> <span class="s s59">Good ones, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a
startup is that there are few checks on releases.</span> <span class="s s61">In true startups,
there are no external checks at all.</span> <span class="s s62">If you have an idea for a new
feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production
servers before lunch.</span> <span class="s s63">And when you can do that, you have more
ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">At big companies, software has to go through various approvals
before it can be launched.</span> <span class="s s65">And the cost of doing this can be
enormous&mdash;in fact, discontinuous.</span> <span class="s s66">I was talking recently to a
group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few
years before by a big company.</span> <span class="s s67">When they'd been independent, they
could release changes instantly.</span> <span class="s s68">Now, they said, the absolute
fastest they could get code released on the production servers was
two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">This didn't merely make them less productive. It made them hate
working for the acquirer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">Here's a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard:
these guys would have paid to be able to release code immediately,
the way they used to.</span> <span class="s s71">I asked them if they'd trade 10% of the
acquisition price for the ability to release code immediately, and
all three instantly said yes.</span> <span class="s s72">Then I asked what was the maximum
percentage of the acquisition price they'd trade for it.</span> <span class="s s73">They said
they didn't want to think about it, because they didn't want to
know how high they'd go, but I got the impression it might be as
much as half.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">They'd have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps
millions, just to be able to deliver more software to users.</span> <span class="s s75">And
you know what?</span> <span class="s s76">It would have been perfectly safe to let them.</span> <span class="s s77">In
fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn't
these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a lot more done.</span>
<span class="s s78">So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater
cost.</span> <span class="s s79">Just like the committee approving software purchases.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not
that you overpay but that the best suppliers won't even sell to
you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your
programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive, but that
good programmers won't even want to work for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">Steve Jobs's famous maxim "artists ship" works both ways.</span> <span class="s s82">Artists
aren't merely capable of shipping.</span> <span class="s s83">They insist on it.</span> <span class="s s84">So if you
don't let people ship, you won't have any artists.</span></p>
