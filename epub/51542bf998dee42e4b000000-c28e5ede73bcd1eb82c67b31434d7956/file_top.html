  <h2><span class="s s1">The Top Idea in Your Mind </span></h2>
<div><div>
<span class="s s2">July 2010I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
morning is more important than I'd thought.</span> <span class="s s3">I knew it was a good
time to have ideas.</span> <span class="s s4">Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to
do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.</span><span class="s s5">Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
else.</span> <span class="s s6">There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to.</span> <span class="s s7">I'm
increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
in solving hard problems, but necessary.</span> <span class="s s8">The tricky part is, you
can only control it indirectly.</span>
<span class="s s9">[1]I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
time.</span> <span class="s s10">That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're
allowed to drift freely.</span> <span class="s s11">And this idea will thus tend to get all
the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
it.</span> <span class="s s12">Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
top one in your mind.</span><span class="s s13">What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the
top one in my mind for two long stretches.</span><span class="s s14">I'd noticed startups got way less done when they started raising
money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
why.</span> <span class="s s15">The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
investors.</span> <span class="s s16">The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
money becomes the top idea in your mind.</span> <span class="s s17">That becomes what you
think about when you take a shower in the morning.</span> <span class="s s18">And that means
other questions aren't.</span><span class="s s19">I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten
why I hated it so much.</span> <span class="s s20">When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
remembered.</span> <span class="s s21">Money matters are particularly likely to become the
top idea in your mind.</span> <span class="s s22">The reason is that they have to be.</span> <span class="s s23">It's
hard to get money.</span> <span class="s s24">It's not the sort of thing that happens by
default.</span> <span class="s s25">It's not going to happen unless you let it become the
thing you think about in the shower.</span> <span class="s s26">And then you'll make little
progress on anything else you'd rather be working on.</span>
<span class="s s27">[2](I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.</span> <span class="s s28">Professors
nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
little research on the side.</span> <span class="s s29">It may be time to fix that.</span><span class="s s30">)The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the
preceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted.</span> <span class="s s31">So
the contrast when I couldn't was sharp.</span> <span class="s s32">But I don't think this
problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen
grinds to a halt when they start raising money&acirc;&#128;&#148;or talking
to acquirers.</span><span class="s s33">You can't directly control where your thoughts drift.</span> <span class="s s34">If you're
controlling them, they're not drifting.</span> <span class="s s35">But you can control them
indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get
into.</span> <span class="s s36">That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
become critical to you.</span> <span class="s s37">Try to get yourself into situations where
the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.</span><span class="s s38">You don't have complete control, of course.</span> <span class="s s39">An emergency could
push other thoughts out of your head.</span> <span class="s s40">But barring emergencies you
have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea
in your mind.</span><span class="s s41">I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth
avoiding&acirc;&#128;&#148;thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push
out more interesting ideas.</span> <span class="s s42">One I've already mentioned: thoughts
about money.</span> <span class="s s43">Getting money is almost by definition an attention
sink.</span>
<span class="s s44">The other is disputes.</span> <span class="s s45">These too are engaging in the
wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely
interesting ideas, but without the substance.</span> <span class="s s46">So avoid disputes
if you want to get real work done.</span>
<span class="s s47">[3]Even Newton fell into this trap.</span> <span class="s s48">After publishing his theory of
colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,
finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:
 I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free
 of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,
 excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come
 out after me.</span> <span class="s s49">For I see a man must either resolve to put out
 nothing new or become a slave to defend it.</span>
<span class="s s50">[4]
Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious
critics.</span> <span class="s s51">Newton's biographer Westfall seems to feel he was
overreacting:
 Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton's "slavery" consisted
 of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over
 the course of a year.</span>
<span class="s s52">I'm more sympathetic to Newton.</span> <span class="s s53">The problem was not the 14 pages,
but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced
as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about
other things.</span><span class="s s54">Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.</span>
<span class="s s55">Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury
itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about
it.</span> <span class="s s56">If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the
second half.</span> <span class="s s57">I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't
deserve space in my head.</span> <span class="s s58">I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten
the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking
about them.</span> <span class="s s59">My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my
motives are purely selfish.</span><span class="s s60">I suspect a lot of people aren't sure what's the top idea in their
mind at any given time.</span> <span class="s s61">I'm often mistaken about it.</span> <span class="s s62">I tend to
think it's the idea I'd want to be the top one, rather than the one
that is.</span> <span class="s s63">But it's easy to figure this out: just take a shower.</span>
<span class="s s64">What topic do your thoughts keep returning to?</span> <span class="s s65">If it's not what
you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.</span><span class="s s66">Notes[1]
No doubt there are already names for this type of thinking, but
I call it "ambient thought.</span><span class="s s67">"</span><span class="s s68">[2]
This was made particularly clear in our case, because neither
of the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the
process dragged on for months.</span> <span class="s s69">Moving large amounts of money around
is never something people treat casually.</span> <span class="s s70">The attention required
increases with the amount&acirc;&#128;&#148;maybe not linearly, but definitely
monotonically.</span><span class="s s71">[3]
Corollary: Avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will
consist of dealing with money and disputes.</span><span class="s s72">[4]
