<p><span class="s s3">One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on
a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them
more.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's
schedule and the maker's schedule.</span> <span class="s s5">The manager's schedule is for
bosses.</span> <span class="s s6">It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with
each day cut into one hour intervals.</span> <span class="s s7">You can block off several
hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change
what you're doing every hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet
with someone.</span> <span class="s s9">Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and
you're done.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule.</span> <span class="s s11">It's the
schedule of command.</span> <span class="s s12">But there's another way of using time that's
common among people who make things, like programmers and writers.</span>
<span class="s s13">They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.</span>
<span class="s s14">You can't write or program well in units of an hour.</span> <span class="s s15">That's barely
enough time to get started.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a
disaster.</span> <span class="s s17">A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking
it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.</span> <span class="s s18">Plus you
have to remember to go to the meeting.</span> <span class="s s19">That's no problem for someone
on the manager's schedule.</span> <span class="s s20">There's always something coming on the
next hour; the only question is what.</span> <span class="s s21">But when someone on the
maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like
throwing an exception.</span> <span class="s s23">It doesn't merely cause you to switch from
one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.</span> <span class="s s25">A meeting
commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or
afternoon.</span> <span class="s s26">But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect.</span>
<span class="s s27">If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less
likely to start something ambitious in the morning.</span> <span class="s s28">I know this
may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own
case.</span> <span class="s s29">Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire
day free to work, with no appointments at all?</span> <span class="s s30">Well, that means
your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't.</span> <span class="s s31">And
ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your
capacity.</span> <span class="s s32">A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">Each type of schedule works fine by itself.</span> <span class="s s34">Problems arise when
they meet.</span> <span class="s s35">Since most powerful people operate on the manager's
schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their
frequency if they want to.</span> <span class="s s36">But the smarter ones restrain themselves,
if they know that some of the people working for them need long
chunks of time to work in.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Our case is an unusual one.</span> <span class="s s38">Nearly all investors, including all
VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule.</span> <span class="s s39">But 
Y Combinator
runs on the maker's schedule.</span> <span class="s s40">Rtm and Trevor and I do because we
always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten
into sync with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like
us.</span> <span class="s s42">I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at
least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago
they started to be able to resist switching from jeans
to suits.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule?</span>
<span class="s s44">By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule
within the maker's: office hours.</span> <span class="s s45">Several times a week I set aside
a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded.</span> <span class="s s46">These chunks of
time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program
that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours
are clustered at the end.</span> <span class="s s47">Because they come at the end of my day
these meetings are never an interruption.</span> <span class="s s48">(Unless their working
day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts
theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to
them.</span><span class="s s49">) During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough
that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved
another trick for partitioning the day.</span> <span class="s s51">I used to program from
dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could
interrupt me.</span> <span class="s s52">Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and
work until dinner on what I called "business stuff.</span><span class="s s53">"</span> <span class="s s54">I never thought
of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,
one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something
you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative
meetings.</span> <span class="s s56">You can meet someone just to get to know one another.</span>
<span class="s s57">If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?</span> <span class="s s58">Maybe it will
turn out you can help one another in some way.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that
matter) have speculative meetings all the time.</span> <span class="s s60">They're effectively
free if you're on the manager's schedule.</span> <span class="s s61">They're so common that
there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you
want to "grab coffee," for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's
schedule, though.</span> <span class="s s63">Which puts us in something of a bind.</span> <span class="s s64">Everyone
assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule.</span>
<span class="s s65">So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or
send us an email proposing we grab coffee.</span> <span class="s s66">At this point we have
two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose
half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably
offend them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source
of the problem.</span> <span class="s s68">We just took it for granted that we had to either
blow our schedules or offend people.</span> <span class="s s69">But now that I've realized
what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something
explaining the two types of schedule.</span> <span class="s s70">Maybe eventually, if the
conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule
starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a
problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise.</span> <span class="s s72">We
know we have to have some number of meetings.</span> <span class="s s73">All we ask from those
on the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.</span></p>
