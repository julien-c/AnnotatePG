  <h2><span class="s s1">Relentlessly Resourceful</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
March 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down
to two words: relentlessly resourceful.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down
to one: hapless.</span> <span class="s s5">Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky.</span> <span class="s s6">But
the dictionaries are not doing a very good job.</span> <span class="s s7">A team that outplays
its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee
could be called unlucky, but not hapless.</span> <span class="s s8">Hapless implies passivity.</span>
<span class="s s9">To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances&mdash;to let the world
have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world.</span>

<span class="s s10">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult
to tell founders what to aim for.</span> <span class="s s12">"Don't be hapless" is not much
of rallying cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors.</span>
<span class="s s14">The best is probably a running back.</span> <span class="s s15">A good running back is not
merely determined, but flexible as well.</span> <span class="s s16">They want to get downfield,
but they adapt their plans on the fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most
people outside the US.</span> <span class="s s18">"Be like a running back" is no better than
"Don't be hapless.</span><span class="s s19">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly.</span>
<span class="s s21">I was writing a talk for 
investors, and I had to explain what to
look for in founders.</span> <span class="s s22">What would someone who was the opposite of
hapless be like?</span> <span class="s s23">They'd be relentlessly resourceful.</span> <span class="s s24">Not merely
relentless.</span> <span class="s s25">That's not enough to make things go your way except
in a few mostly uninteresting domains.</span> <span class="s s26">In any interesting domain,
the difficulties will be novel.</span> <span class="s s27">Which means you can't simply plow
through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are;
you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam
or granite.</span> <span class="s s28">So you have to be resourceful.</span> <span class="s s29">You have to keep
trying new things.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">Be relentlessly resourceful.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">That sounds right, but is it simply a description
of how to be successful in general?</span> <span class="s s32">I don't think so.</span> <span class="s s33">This isn't
the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.</span> <span class="s s34">In
that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious.</span>
<span class="s s35">Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally
are in startups.</span> <span class="s s36">But in writing and painting they're mostly internal;
the obstacle is your own obtuseness.</span>
<span class="s s37">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s38">There probably are other fields where "relentlessly resourceful"
is the recipe for success.</span> <span class="s s39">But though other fields may share it,
I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes
a good startup founder.</span> <span class="s s40">I doubt it could be made more precise.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other
questions.</span> <span class="s s42">For example, can this quality be taught?</span> <span class="s s43">After four
years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly
often it can.</span> <span class="s s44">Not to everyone, but to many people.</span> 
<span class="s s45">[3]
Some
people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent
ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought
out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">This is particularly true of young people who have till now always
been under the thumb of some kind of authority.</span> <span class="s s47">Being relentlessly
resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies,
or in most schools.</span> <span class="s s48">I don't even want to think what the recipe is
in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving
some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building
alliances.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a
question people often wonder about: how many startups there could
be.</span> <span class="s s50">There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper
bound on this number.</span> <span class="s s51">There's no reason to believe there is any
limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb,
any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can
be proven.</span> <span class="s s52">So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups
is the pool of potential founders.</span> <span class="s s53">Some people would make good
founders, and others wouldn't.</span> <span class="s s54">And now that we can say what makes
a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of
the pool.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">This test is also useful to individuals.</span> <span class="s s56">If you want to know whether
you're the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself
whether you're relentlessly resourceful.</span> <span class="s s57">And if you want to know
whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">You can even use it tactically.</span> <span class="s s59">If I were running a startup, this
would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror.</span> <span class="s s60">"Make something people
want" is the destination, but "Be relentlessly resourceful" is how
you get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">[1]
I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the
meaning of the word has shifted.</span> <span class="s s63">No one writing a dictionary from
scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky.</span> <span class="s s64">But a couple
hundred years ago they might have.</span> <span class="s s65">People were more at the mercy
of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words
we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone
that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I couldn't
think of the Italian word for success.</span> <span class="s s67">I spent some time trying
to describe the word I meant.</span> <span class="s s68">Finally she said "Ah!</span> <span class="s s69">Fortuna!</span><span class="s s70">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">[2]
There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be
actively curious.</span> <span class="s s72">There can be times when what you're doing is
almost pure discovery.</span> <span class="s s73">Unfortunately these times are a small
proportion of the whole.</span> <span class="s s74">On the other hand, they are in research
too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">[3]
I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no
idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic
about people's ability to change.</span></p>
