  <h2><span class="s s1">What You'll Wish You'd Known</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">January 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(I wrote this talk for a
high school. I never actually 
gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious.</span>
<span class="s s5">What will you say to high school students?</span> <span class="s s6">So I asked them, what
do you wish someone had told you in high school?</span> <span class="s s7">Their answers
were remarkably similar.</span> <span class="s s8">So I'm going to tell you what we all wish
someone had told us.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high
school: what you want to do with your life.</span> <span class="s s10">People are always
asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer.</span>
<span class="s s11">But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.</span> <span class="s s12">They want
to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to
get you talking.</span> <span class="s s13">They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab
in a tide pool, to see what it does.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd
say that my first priority was to learn what the options were.</span> <span class="s s15">You
don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work.</span> <span class="s s16">What you 
need to do is discover what you like.</span> <span class="s s17">You have to work on stuff 
you like if you want to be good at what you do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you
like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get
an accurate picture of most jobs.</span> <span class="s s19">Being a doctor is not the way
it's portrayed on TV.</span> <span class="s s20">Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,
by volunteering in hospitals.</span> <span class="s s21">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is
doing them yet.</span> <span class="s s23">Most of the work I've done in the last ten years
didn't exist when I was in high school.</span> <span class="s s24">The world changes fast, 
and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up.</span> <span class="s s25">In such a
world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard 
Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your
dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,
because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you
made early on.</span> <span class="s s27">The computer world has a name for this: premature
optimization.</span> <span class="s s28">And it is synonymous with disaster.</span> <span class="s s29">These speakers
would do better to say simply, don't give up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">What they really mean is, don't get demoralized.</span> <span class="s s31">Don't think that 
you can't do what other people can.</span> <span class="s s32">And I agree you shouldn't 
underestimate your potential.</span> <span class="s s33">People who've done great things tend
to seem as if they were a race apart.</span> <span class="s s34">And most biographies only 
exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude 
biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how
the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems
like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding
of some innate genius.</span> <span class="s s35">In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen
year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem
impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">Which is an uncomfortable thought.</span> <span class="s s37">If they were just like us, then
they had to work very hard to do what they did.</span> <span class="s s38">And that's one 
reason we like to believe in genius.</span> <span class="s s39">It gives us an excuse for
being lazy.</span> <span class="s s40">If these guys were able to do what they did only because
of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our
fault if we can't do something as good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius.</span> <span class="s s42">But if you're
trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse 
for being lazy, the other one is probably right.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't
give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do.</span><span class="s s44">"</span>
<span class="s s45">But it needs to be cut still further.</span> <span class="s s46">There is some variation
in natural ability.</span> <span class="s s47">Most people overestimate its role, but it does 
exist.</span> <span class="s s48">If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition 
was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can
do anything if you really try.</span> <span class="s s49">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone
else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate
your abilities.</span><span class="s s51">"</span> <span class="s s52">But as so often happens, the closer you get to
the truth, the messier your sentence gets.</span> <span class="s s53">We've taken a nice, 
neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle.</span> <span class="s s54">It
doesn't make a very good speech anymore.</span> <span class="s s55">But worse still, it doesn't
tell you what to do anymore.</span> <span class="s s56">Someone with your abilities?</span> <span class="s s57">What 
are your abilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">Upwind</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">I think the solution is to work in the other direction.</span> <span class="s s60">Instead
of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.</span>
<span class="s s61">This is what most successful people actually do anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be
in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?</span> 
<span class="s s63">I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future,
but just look at the options available now, and choose those that
will give you the most promising range of options afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting
your time.</span> <span class="s s65">Work on things that interest you and increase your
options, and worry later about which you'll take.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math 
or economics.</span> <span class="s s67">Well, math will give you more options: you can go into
almost any field from math.</span> <span class="s s68">If you major in math it will be easy
to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics
it will be hard to get into grad school in math.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">Flying a glider is a good metaphor here.</span> <span class="s s70">Because a glider doesn't
have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot
of altitude.</span> <span class="s s71">If you let yourself get far downwind of good places 
to land, your options narrow uncomfortably.</span> <span class="s s72">As a rule you want to
stay upwind.</span> <span class="s s73">So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give 
up on your dreams."</span> <span class="s s74">Stay upwind.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics,
how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out.</span>  <span class="s s77">Look for smart people
and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you
can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it.</span> <span class="s s78">But
it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of 
faking going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look
much the same.</span> <span class="s s80">The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual
and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders.</span> <span class="s s81">But while in some
fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard
ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to
seem as if they're saying something important.</span> <span class="s s82">This may seem a 
scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified,
in the famous Social Text affair.</span> <span class="s s83">Suspecting that the papers
published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding
nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of
intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary
theory journal, which published it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. 
Writing novels is hard.</span> <span class="s s85">Reading novels isn't.</span> 
<span class="s s86">Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that
something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be 
able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard
enough.</span> <span class="s s87">There has to be suspense.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think.</span> <span class="s s89">What I'm
telling you is that you should worry?</span> <span class="s s90">Yes, but it's not as bad as
it sounds.</span> <span class="s s91">It's exhilarating to overcome worries.</span> <span class="s s92">You don't see
faces much happier than people winning gold medals.</span> <span class="s s93">And you know
why they're so happy?</span> <span class="s s94">Relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some
kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">Ambition</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems." And 
you can start today. I wish I'd grasped that in
high school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">Most people like to be good at what they do.</span> <span class="s s99">In the so-called real 
world this need is a powerful force.</span> <span class="s s100">But high school students
rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do.</span> 
<span class="s s101">When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to 
be a high school student.</span> <span class="s s102">And so I let my need to be good at what 
I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between
high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had 
to earn a living.</span> <span class="s s104">Wrong.</span> <span class="s s105">It's that adults take responsibility for
themselves.</span> <span class="s s106">Making a living is only a small part of it.</span>
<span class="s s107">Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day
job.</span> <span class="s s109">I don't mean that I'd slack in school.</span> <span class="s s110">Working at something
as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly.</span> <span class="s s111">It means not being defined
by it.</span> <span class="s s112">I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student,
just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of 
himself as a waiter.</span> <span class="s s113">[3] And when I wasn't working at my day job
I'd start trying to do real work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they
nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.</span> <span class="s s115">If
you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most
later, that's probably it.</span> <span class="s s116">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students
aren't capable of getting anything done yet.</span> <span class="s s118">But I don't think
this is true.</span> <span class="s s119">And the proof is that you're bored.</span> <span class="s s120">You probably
weren't bored when you were eight.</span> <span class="s s121">When you're eight it's called
"playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing.</span> <span class="s s122">And
when I was eight, I was rarely bored.</span> <span class="s s123">Give me a back yard and a
few other kids and I could play all day.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s124">The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now
realize, is that I was ready for something else.</span> <span class="s s125">Childhood was
getting old.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you
should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work.</span>
<span class="s s127">Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake.</span> <span class="s s128">You enjoy it more
if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate 
cake for every meal.</span> <span class="s s129">No matter how much you like chocolate cake,
you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it.</span> <span class="s s130">And that's 
what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness.</span>
<span class="s s131">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades.</span> <span class="s s133">We
have to have extracurricular activities.</span> <span class="s s134">But you know
perfectly well how bogus most of these are.</span> <span class="s s135">Collecting donations
for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard.</span>
<span class="s s136">It's not getting something done.</span> <span class="s s137">What I mean by getting something
done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers,
or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to 
draw the human face from life.</span> <span class="s s138">This sort of thing rarely translates
into a line item on a college application.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">Corruption</span></p>
<p><span class="s s140">It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college, 
because the people you have to impress to get into college are not 
a very discerning audience.</span> <span class="s s141">At most colleges, it's not the professors
who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they
are nowhere near as smart.</span> <span class="s s142">They're the NCOs of the intellectual
world.</span> <span class="s s143">They can't tell how smart you are.</span>
<span class="s s144">The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">Few parents
would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't 
improve their admissions prospects.</span> <span class="s s146">Prep schools openly say this
is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to 
think about it, is that they can
hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid
and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he 
went to the local public school.</span> <span class="s s147">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s148">Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising
college applicant.</span> <span class="s s149">But that means you're designing your life to
satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted
to subverting it.</span> <span class="s s150">No wonder you become cynical.</span> <span class="s s151">The malaise you
feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco 
industry executive feels.</span> <span class="s s152">And you don't even get paid a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">So what do you do?</span> <span class="s s154">What you should not do is rebel.</span> <span class="s s155">That's what
I did, and it was a mistake.</span> <span class="s s156">I didn't realize exactly what was 
happening to us, but I smelled a major rat.</span> <span class="s s157">And so I just gave up.</span>
<span class="s s158">Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s159">When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's
Notes, it seemed par for the course.</span> <span class="s s160">Surely it meant nothing to
get a good grade in such a class.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">In retrospect this was stupid.</span> <span class="s s162">It was like someone getting fouled
in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the
rules, and walking off the field in indignation.</span> <span class="s s163">Fouls happen.</span> 
<span class="s s164">The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool.</span> <span class="s s165">Just
keep playing.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s167">By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you.</span> <span class="s s168">Yes, 
as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is 
crap.</span> <span class="s s169">And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is
largely a charade.</span> <span class="s s170">But like many fouls, this one was unintentional.</span>
<span class="s s171">[7] So just keep playing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience.</span> <span class="s s173">In either case you let
yourself be defined by what they tell you to do.</span> <span class="s s174">The best plan, I
think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector.</span> <span class="s s175">Don't just do what 
they tell you, and don't just refuse to.</span> <span class="s s176">Instead treat school as
a day job.</span> <span class="s s177">As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet.</span> <span class="s s178">You're done at 3
o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s179">Curiosity</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">And what's your real job supposed to be?</span> <span class="s s181">Unless you're Mozart, 
your first task is to figure that out.</span> <span class="s s182">What are the great things
to work on?</span> <span class="s s183">Where are the imaginative people?</span> <span class="s s184">And most importantly,
what are you interested in?</span> <span class="s s185">The word "aptitude" is misleading,
because it implies something innate.</span> <span class="s s186">The most powerful sort of
aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests
are often acquired tastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s187">A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture
under the name "passion.</span><span class="s s188">"</span> <span class="s s189">I recently saw an ad for waiters saying
they wanted people with a "passion for service.</span><span class="s s190">"</span> <span class="s s191">The real thing 
is not something one could have for waiting on tables.</span> <span class="s s192">And passion
is a bad word for it.</span> <span class="s s193">A better name would be curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s194">Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid
curiosity.</span> <span class="s s195">Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at
random about everything.</span> <span class="s s196">In most adults this curiosity dries up
entirely.</span> <span class="s s197">It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always
asking why about everything.</span> <span class="s s198">But in ambitious adults, instead of
drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep.</span> <span class="s s199">The mud flat morphs
into a well.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s200">Curiosity turns work into play.</span> <span class="s s201">For Einstein, relativity wasn't a
book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam.</span> <span class="s s202">It was a
mystery he was trying to solve.</span> <span class="s s203">So it probably felt like less work
to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it
in a class.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s204">One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea
that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.</span> <span class="s s205">Most subjects
are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that
you can flog yourself through them.</span> <span class="s s206">So I was surprised when, early
in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no 
self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, 
not even a cup of coffee.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s207">Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same
with all of them.</span> <span class="s s208">They have little discipline.</span> <span class="s s209">They're all terrible
procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves
do anything they're not interested in.</span> <span class="s s210">One still hasn't sent out
his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago.</span>
<span class="s s211">Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s212">I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline.</span> <span class="s s213">You 
probably need about the amount you need to go running.</span> <span class="s s214">I'm often 
reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it.</span> <span class="s s215">And if I don't 
run for several days, I feel ill.</span> <span class="s s216">It's the same with people who 
do great things.</span> <span class="s s217">They know they'll feel bad if they don't work,
and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks
to start working.</span> <span class="s s218">But once they get started, interest takes over,
and discipline is no longer necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently
trying to write Great Literature?</span> <span class="s s220">Of course not.</span> <span class="s s221">He was having
fun.</span> <span class="s s222">That's why he's so good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s223">If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity 
about a promising question.</span> <span class="s s224">The critical moment for Einstein
was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell
is going on here?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s225">It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it
can take years to figure out what a subject is really about.</span> <span class="s s226">To
take an extreme example, consider math.</span> <span class="s s227">Most people think they
hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name
"mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s228">The great mathematician G.</span> <span class="s s229">H.</span> <span class="s s230">Hardy said he didn't like math in 
high school either.</span> <span class="s s231">He only took it up because he was better at
it than the other students.</span> <span class="s s232">Only later did he realize math was
interesting-- only later did he start to ask questions instead of
merely answering them correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s233">When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a
paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it
interesting.</span> <span class="s s234">That's what you need to do: find a question that makes
the world interesting.</span> <span class="s s235">People who do great things look at the same
world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's
compellingly mysterious.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s236">And not only in intellectual matters.</span> <span class="s s237">Henry Ford's great question 
was, why do cars have to be a luxury item?</span> <span class="s s238">What would happen if
you treated them as a commodity?</span> <span class="s s239">Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect,
why does everyone have to stay in his position?</span> <span class="s s240">Why can't defenders
score goals too?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s241">Now</span></p>
<p><span class="s s242">If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now,
at sixteen?</span> <span class="s s243">Work toward finding one.</span> <span class="s s244">Great questions don't appear
suddenly.</span> <span class="s s245">They gradually congeal in your head.</span> <span class="s s246">And what makes
them congeal is experience.</span> <span class="s s247">So the way to find great questions is
not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great 
discovery shall I make?</span> <span class="s s248">You can't answer that; if you could, you'd 
have made it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s249">The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for
big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you,
and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can
take roost.</span> <span class="s s250">Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe.</span>
<span class="s s251">They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys.</span> <span class="s s252">So 
when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to
notice it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s253">Put in time how and on what?</span> <span class="s s254">Just pick a project that seems
interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something,
or to answer some question.</span> <span class="s s255">Choose a project that will take less
than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish.</span>
<span class="s s256">Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially 
at first.</span> <span class="s s257">If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever 
seems most fun.</span> <span class="s s258">If one blows up in your face, start another.</span> <span class="s s259">Repeat
till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes 
self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one.</span> <span class="s s260">(This
could take years.</span><span class="s s261">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s262">It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that
will restrict you or make it seem like work.</span> <span class="s s263">Involve your friends
if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes.</span> 
<span class="s s264">Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person),
but secrecy also has its advantages.</span> <span class="s s265">There's something pleasing
about a secret project.</span> <span class="s s266">And you can take more risks, because no 
one will know if you fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s267">Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some
goal you're supposed to have.</span> <span class="s s268">Paths can bend a lot more than you
think.</span> <span class="s s269">So let the path grow out the project.</span> <span class="s s270">The most important
thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you 
learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s271">Don't disregard unseemly motivations.</span> <span class="s s272">One of the most powerful is
the desire to be better than other people at something.</span> <span class="s s273">Hardy said
that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing 
about him is that he admitted it.</span> <span class="s s274">Another powerful motivator is
the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to.</span> <span class="s s275">Closely
related is the desire to do something audacious.</span> <span class="s s276">Sixteen year olds
aren't supposed to write novels.</span> <span class="s s277">So if you try, anything you achieve
is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing
no worse than expectations.</span> <span class="s s278">[8]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s279">Beware of bad models.</span> <span class="s s280">Especially when they excuse laziness.</span> <span class="s s281">When 
I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories
like ones I'd seen by famous writers.</span> <span class="s s282">My stories didn't have a lot
of plot, but they were very deep.</span> <span class="s s283">And they were less work to write
than entertaining ones would have been.</span> <span class="s s284">I should have known that
was a danger sign.</span> <span class="s s285">And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; 
what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff
like the famous writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s286">Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers
actually sucked.</span> <span class="s s287">Plenty of famous people do; in the short term,
the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame.</span> 
<span class="s s288">I should have been less worried about doing something
that seemed cool, and just done something I liked.</span> <span class="s s289">That's the
actual road to coolness anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s290">A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is 
to find good books.</span> <span class="s s291">Most books are bad.</span> <span class="s s292">Nearly all textbooks are
bad.</span> <span class="s s293">[9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever
book on it happens to be closest.</span> <span class="s s294">You have to search actively for 
the tiny number of good books.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s295">The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of
waiting to be taught, go out and learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s296">Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers.</span> <span class="s s297">It 
could be shaped by your own curiosity.</span> <span class="s s298">It is for all ambitious 
adults.</span> <span class="s s299">And you don't have to wait to start.</span> <span class="s s300">In fact, you don't 
have to wait to be an adult.</span> <span class="s s301">There's no switch inside you that
magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some
institution.</span> <span class="s s302">You start being an adult when you decide to take
responsibility for your life.</span> <span class="s s303">You can do that at any age.</span> <span class="s s304">[10]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s305">This may sound like bullshit.</span> <span class="s s306">I'm just a minor, you may think, I
have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults 
tell me all day long.</span> <span class="s s307">Well, most adults labor under restrictions 
just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done.</span> <span class="s s308">If you
think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s309">The only real difference between adults and high school kids is
that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school
kids don't.</span> <span class="s s310">That realization hits most people around 23.</span> <span class="s s311">But I'm
letting you in on the secret early.</span> <span class="s s312">So get to work.</span> <span class="s s313">Maybe you can
be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't
how much time you wasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s314">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s315">[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate 
picture.</span> <span class="s s316">"Who knew how much time it would take up, how little
autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how
unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?</span><span class="s s317">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s318">[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate
the NBA into letting him play.</span> <span class="s s319">So far the closest anyone has come
is Secretary of Labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s320">[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what
you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s321">Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for
some students to get good grades.</span> <span class="s s322">If you treat your classes
as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s323">However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to 
get into a decent college.</span> <span class="s s324">And that is worth doing, because
universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these
days.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s325">[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant
things. And especially about what other people thought of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s326">I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what
random people thought of them.</span> <span class="s s327">Adults care just as much what other
people think, but they get to be more selective about the other
people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s328">I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about,
and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me.</span> <span class="s s329">The
problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by 
accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect
for their judgement.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s330">[5] The key to wasting time is distraction.</span> <span class="s s331">Without distractions
it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with
it, and you start to feel uncomfortable.</span> <span class="s s332">If you want to measure 
how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment:
set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think.</span>
<span class="s s333">You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing
else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, 
newspapers, or magazines.</span> <span class="s s334">Within an hour most people will feel a 
strong craving for distraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s335">[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools
is to trick admissions officers.</span> <span class="s s336">They also generally provide a 
better education.</span> <span class="s s337">But try this thought experiment: suppose prep
schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.</span><span class="s s338">001)
negative effect on college admissions.</span> <span class="s s339">How many parents would still
send their kids to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s340">It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because
they've learned more, are better college candidates.</span> <span class="s s341">But
this seems empirically false.</span> <span class="s s342">What you learn in even the best high
school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college.</span> 
<span class="s s343">Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, 
but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s344">(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just
that they are within any given college.</span> <span class="s s345">That follows necessarily
if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.</span><span class="s s346">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s347">[7] Why does society foul you?</span> <span class="s s348">Indifference, mainly.</span> <span class="s s349">There are
simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good.</span> <span class="s s350">The air
traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise.</span>
<span class="s s351">Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take
their customers.</span> <span class="s s352">But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it
has no competitors.</span> <span class="s s353">High school isn't evil; it's random; but random
is pretty bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s354">[8] And then of course there is money.</span> <span class="s s355">It's not a big factor in
high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants.</span> <span class="s s356">But a
lot of great things were created mainly to make money.</span> <span class="s s357">Samuel
Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.</span><span class="s s358">"</span>
<span class="s s359">(Many hope he was exaggerating.</span><span class="s s360">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s361">[9] Even college textbooks are bad.</span> <span class="s s362">When you get to college,
you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are
not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe.</span>
<span class="s s363">Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people
who need the money.</span> <span class="s s364">It's unpleasant because the publishers exert
so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision
by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing.</span> <span class="s s365">This phenomenon
is apparently 
even worse in the production of high school textbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s366">[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults.</span>
<span class="s s367">I wonder if they'd like it if you did.</span> <span class="s s368">You may be loud and
disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults.</span> <span class="s s369">If you
actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch
of adults had been transposed into your bodies.</span> <span class="s s370">Imagine the reaction
of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had
to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go
at a time.</span> <span class="s s371">To say nothing of the things you're taught.</span> <span class="s s372">If a bunch
of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school,
the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the
rules with the administration.</span></p>
