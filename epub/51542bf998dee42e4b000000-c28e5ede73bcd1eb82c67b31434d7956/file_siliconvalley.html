  <h2><span class="s s1">How to Be Silicon Valley</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">May 2006</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something
unique about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other
countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US
either.</span> <span class="s s6">What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">What it takes is the right people.</span> <span class="s s8">If you could get the right ten
thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo
would become Silicon Valley.</span> 
<span class="s s9">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">That's a striking departure from the past.</span> <span class="s s11">Up till a couple decades
ago, geography was destiny for cities.</span> <span class="s s12">All great cities were located
on waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was the
only economical way to ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right
people to move there.</span> <span class="s s14">So the question of how to make a silicon
valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them
to move?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">Two Types</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">I think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology
hub: rich people and nerds.</span> <span class="s s17">They're the limiting reagents in the
reaction that produces startups, because they're the only ones
present when startups get started.</span> <span class="s s18">Everyone else will move.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup
hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.</span> <span class="s s20">Few
startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it's full
of rich people, it has few nerds.</span> <span class="s s21">It's not the kind of place nerds
like.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but
no rich people.</span> <span class="s s23">The top US Computer Science departments are said
to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.</span> <span class="s s24">MIT yielded
Route 128.</span> <span class="s s25">Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s26">But
Carnegie-Mellon?</span> <span class="s s27">The record skips at that point.</span> <span class="s s28">Lower down the
list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community
in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in
Austin.</span> <span class="s s29">But what happened in Pittsburgh?</span> <span class="s s30">And in Ithaca, home of
Cornell, which is also high on the list?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can
answer for both.</span> <span class="s s32">The weather is terrible, particularly in winter,
and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is
in Boston.</span> <span class="s s33">Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.</span>
<span class="s s34">So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups,
there's no one to invest in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">Not Bureaucrats</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">Do you really need the rich people?</span> <span class="s s37">Wouldn't it work to have the
government invest in the nerds?</span> <span class="s s38">No, it would not.</span> <span class="s s39">Startup investors
are a distinct type of rich people.</span> <span class="s s40">They tend to have a lot of
experience themselves in the technology business.</span> <span class="s s41">This (a) helps
them pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply advice
and connections as well as money.</span> <span class="s s42">And the fact that they have a
personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people
from startup investors.</span> <span class="s s44">The idea of them making startup investments
is comic.</span> <span class="s s45">It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or
perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal.</span>
<span class="s s46">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly.</span> <span class="s s48">We just
don't notice usually, because they only have to compete against
other bureaucrats.</span> <span class="s s49">But as startup investors they'd have to compete
against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid
them to make their own investment decisions.</span> <span class="s s51">Most are only allowed
to invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing
to act as lead investor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Not Buildings</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings.</span>
<span class="s s54">But it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings.</span>
<span class="s s55">I read occasionally about attempts to set up "technology
parks" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon
Valley were the office space.</span> <span class="s s56">An article about Sophia Antipolis
bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and
Nortel.</span> <span class="s s57">Don't the French realize these aren't startups?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a
silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup
happens before they want that kind of space.</span> <span class="s s59">The key stage is when
they're three guys operating out of an apartment.</span> <span class="s s60">Wherever the
startup is when it gets funded, it will stay.</span> <span class="s s61">The defining quality
of Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have offices
there, but that they were started there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce
is those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen table
deciding to start a company.</span> <span class="s s63">And to reproduce that you need those
people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">Universities</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">The exciting thing is, all you need are the people.</span> <span class="s s66">If you could
attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere,
you could reproduce Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s67">And both groups are highly
mobile.</span> <span class="s s68">They'll go where life is good.</span> <span class="s s69">So what makes a place good
to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">What nerds like is other nerds.</span> <span class="s s71">Smart people will go wherever other
smart people are.</span> <span class="s s72">And in particular, to great universities.</span> <span class="s s73">In
theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far
universities seem to be indispensable.</span> <span class="s s74">Within the US, there are
no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least,
first-rate computer science departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a
university, but one of the top handful in the world.</span> <span class="s s76">It has to be
good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands
of miles away.</span> <span class="s s77">And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets
like MIT and Stanford.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s78">This sounds hard.</span> <span class="s s79">Actually it might be easy.</span> <span class="s s80">My professor friends,
when they're deciding where they'd like to work, consider one thing
above all: the quality of the other faculty.</span> <span class="s s81">What attracts professors
is good colleagues.</span> <span class="s s82">So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a
significant number of the best young researchers, you could create
a first-rate university from nothing overnight.</span> <span class="s s83">And you could do
that for surprisingly little.</span> <span class="s s84">If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses
of $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would
bear comparison with any in the world.</span> <span class="s s85">And from that point the
chain reaction would be self-sustaining.</span> <span class="s s86">So whatever it costs to
establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or
so you could have a great one.</span> 
<span class="s s87">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">Personality</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">However, merely creating a new university would not be enough to
start a silicon valley.</span> <span class="s s90">The university is just the seed.</span> <span class="s s91">It has
to be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate.</span> <span class="s s92">Plant it
in the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has
attractions other than the university.</span> <span class="s s94">It has to be a place where
investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">The two like much the same things, because most startup investors
are nerds themselves.</span> <span class="s s96">So what do nerds look for in a town?</span> <span class="s s97">Their
tastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a
lot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist
destinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.</span> <span class="s s98">But their tastes
can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big
tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">There has been a lot written lately about the "creative class.</span><span class="s s100">"</span> <span class="s s101">The
thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,
cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.</span> <span class="s s102">That
is certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam's prosperity
400 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general.</span>
<span class="s s104">For example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead of
cookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurants
instead of national chains.</span> <span class="s s105">Like the rest of the creative class,
they want to live somewhere with personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">What exactly is personality?</span> <span class="s s107">I think it's the feeling that each
building is the work of a distinct group of people.</span> <span class="s s108">A town with
personality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced.</span> <span class="s s109">So if you want
to make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the "creative class"--
you probably have to ban large development projects.</span>
<span class="s s110">When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you
can always tell.</span> 
<span class="s s111">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">Most towns with personality are old, but they don't have to be.</span>
<span class="s s113">Old towns have two advantages: they're denser, because they were
laid out before cars, and they're more varied, because they were
built one building at a time.</span> <span class="s s114">You could have both now.</span> <span class="s s115">Just have
building codes that ensure density, and ban large scale developments.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s116">A corollary is that you have to keep out the biggest developer of
all: the government.</span> <span class="s s117">A government that asks "How can we build a
silicon valley?</span><span class="s s118">"</span> <span class="s s119">has probably ensured failure by the way they framed
the question.</span> <span class="s s120">You don't build a silicon valley; you let one grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s121">Nerds</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">If you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with
personality.</span> <span class="s s123">You need a town with the right personality.</span> <span class="s s124">Nerds
are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes
from the rest.</span> <span class="s s125">You can see this most clearly in New York, which
attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds.</span> 
<span class="s s126">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s127">What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.</span>
<span class="s s128">This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,
where people walk, but not smiling.</span> <span class="s s129">When I was in grad school in
Boston, a friend came to visit from New York.</span> <span class="s s130">On the subway back
from the airport she asked "Why is everyone smiling?</span><span class="s s131">"</span> <span class="s s132">I looked and
they weren't smiling.</span> <span class="s s133">They just looked like they were compared to
the facial expressions she was used to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">If you've lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions
come from.</span> <span class="s s135">It's the kind of place where your mind may be excited,
but your body knows it's having a bad time.</span> <span class="s s136">People don't so much
enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.</span>
<span class="s s137">And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.</span>
<span class="s s138">It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life
isotopes of style and fame.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York
is a mystery.</span> <span class="s s140">People who like New York will pay a fortune for a
small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the
cool people are really cool.</span> <span class="s s141">A nerd looks at that deal and sees
only: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">Nerds will pay a premium to live in a town where the smart people
are really smart, but you don't have to pay as much for that.</span> <span class="s s143">It's
supply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for
it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">Most nerds like quieter pleasures.</span> <span class="s s145">They like cafes instead of
clubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking
instead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.</span> <span class="s s146">A nerd's
idea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s147">Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="s s148">It's the young nerds who start startups, so it's those specifically
the city has to appeal to.</span> <span class="s s149">The startup hubs in the US are all
young-feeling towns.</span> <span class="s s150">This doesn't mean they have to be new.</span>
<span class="s s151">Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young
because it's full of students.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s152">What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a
large, existing population of stodgy people.</span> <span class="s s153">It would be a waste
of time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial town
like Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups.</span> <span class="s s154">Those
places have too much momentum in the wrong direction.</span> <span class="s s155">You're better
off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.</span> <span class="s s156">Or
better still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that
one.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s157">The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades
before it was associated with technology.</span> <span class="s s158">It was a place people
went in search of something new.</span> <span class="s s159">And so it became synonymous with
California nuttiness.</span> <span class="s s160">There's still a lot of that there.</span> <span class="s s161">If you
wanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's "energy," for
example, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would
be the place to do it.</span> <span class="s s162">But a place that tolerates oddness in the
search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because
economically that's what startups are.</span> <span class="s s163">Most good startup ideas
seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone
would have done them already.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s164">(How many people are going to want computers in their houses?
What, another search engine?)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s165">That's the connection between technology and liberalism.</span> <span class="s s166">Without
exception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal.</span>
<span class="s s167">But it's not because liberals are smarter that this is so.</span> <span class="s s168">It's
because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by
definition have odd ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">Conversely, a town that gets praised for being "solid" or representing
"traditional values" may be a fine place to live, but it's never
going to succeed as a startup hub.</span> <span class="s s170">The 2004 presidential election,
though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with
a county-by-county 
map of such places.</span> 
<span class="s s171">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">To attract the young, a town must have an intact center.</span> <span class="s s173">In most
American cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if
any, is in the suburbs.</span> <span class="s s174">Most American cities have been turned
inside out.</span> <span class="s s175">But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco,
or Boston, or Seattle.</span> <span class="s s176">They all have intact centers.</span>
<span class="s s177">[7]
My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a
startup hub.</span> <span class="s s178">Young people don't want to live in the suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s179">Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned
into new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.</span> <span class="s s180">Both have the
kind of effervescent feel that attracts the young.</span> <span class="s s181">They're each
only a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if they
wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">Time</span></p>
<p><span class="s s183">A great university near an attractive town.</span> <span class="s s184">Is that all it takes?</span>
<span class="s s185">That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s186">Silicon
Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors
of the transistor.</span> <span class="s s187">He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize
at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved
to Palo Alto to do it.</span> <span class="s s188">At the time that was an odd thing to do.</span>
<span class="s s189">Why did he?</span> <span class="s s190">Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice
it was.</span> <span class="s s191">Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming
college town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and San
Francisco only an hour away.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in
various ways from Shockley Semiconductor.</span> <span class="s s193">Shockley was a difficult
man, and in 1957 his top people-- "the traitorous eight"-- left to
start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.</span> <span class="s s194">Among them were
Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and
Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.</span> <span class="s s195">Forty-two
years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible
for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to
work for Intel.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s196">So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't
make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links
back to Shockley.</span> <span class="s s197">There's a lesson here: startups beget startups.</span>
<span class="s s198">People who work for startups start their own.</span> <span class="s s199">People who get rich
from startups fund new ones.</span> <span class="s s200">I suspect this kind of organic growth
is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way
to grow the expertise you need.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s201">That has two important implications.</span> <span class="s s202">The first is that you need
time to grow a silicon valley.</span> <span class="s s203">The university you could create in
a couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow
organically.</span> <span class="s s204">The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a
company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s205">The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you
can't be somewhat of a startup hub.</span> <span class="s s206">You either have a self-sustaining
chain reaction, or not.</span> <span class="s s207">Observation confirms this too: cities
either have a startup scene, or they don't.</span> <span class="s s208">There is no middle
ground.</span> <span class="s s209">Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.</span>
<span class="s s210">As source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s211">The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.</span> <span class="s s212">Shockley
Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.</span>
<span class="s s213">It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology
together in a place they liked enough to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s214">Competing</span></p>
<p><span class="s s215">Of course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original
one didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s216">Can that be
done?</span> <span class="s s217">Probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital
firms. This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds
didn't exist.</span> <span class="s s219">In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild
Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.</span> <span class="s s220">They were
subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and
Instrument respectively.</span> <span class="s s221">Those companies were apparently willing
to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s222">Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's
drive.</span> <span class="s s223">For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.</span>
<span class="s s224">But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them
to move.</span> <span class="s s225">They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings,
and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s226">The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause
startups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through
acquisitions.</span> <span class="s s227">And although the first may be weakening because it's
now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.</span>
<span class="s s228">Three of the most admired
"Web 2.</span><span class="s s229">0" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs,
but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s230">Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to
get started.</span> <span class="s s231">But by no means impossible.</span> <span class="s s232">Ultimately power rests
with the founders.</span> <span class="s s233">A startup with the best people will beat one
with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently
successful would never have to move.</span> <span class="s s234">So a town that
could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and
perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s235">For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise
Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.</span> <span class="s s236">San Francisco
and Berkeley are great, but they're forty miles away.</span> <span class="s s237">Silicon
Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl.</span> <span class="s s238">It
has fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than the
soul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities.</span> <span class="s s239">But a competitor
that managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage.</span> <span class="s s240">All a city
needs is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look at
and say "I want to stay here," and that would be enough to get the
chain reaction started.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s241">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s242">[1]
It's interesting to consider how low this number could be
made.</span> <span class="s s243">I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could
bring no assets with them.</span> <span class="s s244">Probably just thirty, if I could pick them, 
would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s245">[2]
Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately
well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource
most of the work of selection.</span> <span class="s s246">A professor at a famous university
who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much
regardless of the proposal.</span> <span class="s s247">That wouldn't work for startups, whose
founders aren't sponsored by organizations, and are often unknowns.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s248">[3]
You'd have to do it all at once, or at least a whole department
at a time, because people would be more likely to come if they
knew their friends were.</span> <span class="s s249">And you should probably start from scratch,
rather than trying to upgrade an existing university, or much energy
would be lost in friction.</span></p>
