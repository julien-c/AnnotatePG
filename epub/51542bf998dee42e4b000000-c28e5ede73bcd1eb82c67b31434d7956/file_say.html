  <h2><span class="s s1">What You Can't Say</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">January 2004</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s3">Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and
been embarrassed at the way you looked?</span> <span class="s s4">Did we actually
dress like that?</span> <span class="s s5">We did.</span> <span class="s s6">And we had no idea how
silly we looked.</span>
<span class="s s7">It's the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the
same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all
of us riding on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">What scares me is that there are moral fashions too.</span>
<span class="s s9">They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people.</span>
<span class="s s10">But they're much more dangerous.</span>
<span class="s s11">Fashion is mistaken for good design; 
moral fashion is mistaken for good.</span>
<span class="s s12">Dressing oddly gets you laughed at.</span> <span class="s s13">Violating
moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or
even killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing
would be true no matter where you went: you'd have to watch
what you said.</span> 
<span class="s s15">Opinions we consider harmless could have 
gotten you in big trouble.</span>
<span class="s s16">I've already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big
trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century,
and did get Galileo in big trouble when he said
it-- that the earth moves.</span> <span class="s s17">[1]</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s18">It seems to be a constant throughout history: In every
period, people believed things that were just ridiculous,
and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in
terrible trouble for saying otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Is our time any different?</span>
<span class="s s20">To anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer is
almost certainly no.</span> <span class="s s21">It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours
were the first era to get everything just right.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">It's tantalizing to think we believe
things that people in the future will find ridiculous.</span>
<span class="s s23">What would someone coming back to visit us in a time machine
have to be careful not to say?</span>
<span class="s s24">That's what I want to study here.</span>
<span class="s s25">But
I want to do more than just shock everyone with
the heresy du jour.</span> <span class="s s26">I want to find general
recipes for discovering what you can't say, in any era.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">The Conformist Test</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">Let's start with a test: 
Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express
in front of a group of your peers?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">If the answer is no,
you might want to stop and think about that.</span> <span class="s s30">If everything
you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could
that possibly be a coincidence?</span> <span class="s s31">Odds are it isn't.</span> <span class="s s32">Odds are
you just think whatever you're told.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">The other alternative would be that you independently considered
every question and came up with the exact same answers that
are now considered acceptable.</span> <span class="s s34">That seems unlikely, because
you'd also have to make the same mistakes.</span> <span class="s s35">Mapmakers
deliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they can
tell when someone copies them.</span> <span class="s s36">If another map has the same
mistake, that's very convincing evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly
contains a few mistakes.</span> <span class="s s38">And anyone who makes the same mistakes
probably didn't do it by accident.</span> <span class="s s39">It would be
like someone claiming they had independently decided in
1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">If you believe everything you're supposed to now, how can
you be sure you wouldn't also have believed everything you
were supposed to if you had grown up among the plantation
owners of the pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s-- or
among the Mongols in 1200, for that matter?</span> <span class="s s41">Odds are you
would have.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">Back in the era of terms like "well-adjusted," the idea
seemed to be that there was something wrong with
you if you thought things you didn't dare say out loud.</span>
<span class="s s43">This seems backward.</span> <span class="s s44">Almost certainly, there
is something wrong with you if you don't think things
you don't dare say out loud.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">Trouble</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">What can't we say? One way to find these ideas is simply to look
at things people do say, and get in trouble for. [2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">Of course, we're not just looking for things we can't say.</span> 
<span class="s s48">We're looking for things we can't say that are true, or at least
have enough chance of being true that the question
should remain open.</span> <span class="s s49">But many of the
things people get in trouble for saying probably
do make it over this second, lower threshold.</span> <span class="s s50">No one
gets in trouble for saying
that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall.</span>
<span class="s s51">Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or
at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to
make anyone mad.</span> <span class="s s52">The statements that make people mad are
the ones they worry might be believed.</span>
<span class="s s53">I suspect the statements that make people maddest
are those they worry might be true.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall,
he would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric.</span> <span class="s s55">Saying 
the earth orbited the sun was another matter.</span> <span class="s s56">The church knew
this would set people thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">Certainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb works
well.</span> <span class="s s58">A lot of the statements people got in trouble for seem
harmless now.</span> <span class="s s59">So it's likely that visitors from the
future would agree with at least some of the statements that
get people in trouble today.</span> <span class="s s60">Do we have no Galileos?</span> <span class="s s61">Not
likely.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">To find them,
keep track of opinions that get
people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?</span>
<span class="s s63">Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but
might it also be true?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">Heresy</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">This won't get us all the answers, though.</span> <span class="s s66">What if no one
happens to have gotten in trouble for a particular idea yet?</span>
<span class="s s67">What if some idea would be so radioactively controversial that
no one would dare express it in public?</span> <span class="s s68">How can we find these too?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">Another approach is to follow that word, heresy.</span> <span class="s s70">In every period
of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to 
statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask
if they were true or not.</span> <span class="s s71">"Blasphemy", "sacrilege", and "heresy"
were such
labels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times
"indecent", "improper", and "unamerican" have been.</span> <span class="s s72">By now these
labels have lost their sting.</span> <span class="s s73">They always do.</span>
<span class="s s74">By now they're mostly used ironically.</span>
<span class="s s75">But in their time,
they had real force.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">The word "defeatist", for example, has no particular political
connotations now.</span>
<span class="s s77">But in Germany in 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff in
a purge of those who favored a negotiated peace.</span>
<span class="s s78">At the start of World War II it was used
extensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their
opponents.</span>
<span class="s s79">In 1940, any argument against Churchill's aggressive policy was "defeatist".</span>
<span class="s s80">Was it right or wrong?</span> <span class="s s81">Ideally, no one got far enough to ask
that.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s82">We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them,
from the all-purpose "inappropriate" to the dreaded "divisive.</span><span class="s s83">"</span>
<span class="s s84">In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are,
simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree
with besides untrue.</span> <span class="s s85">When a politician says his opponent is
mistaken, that's a straightforward criticism, but when he
attacks a statement as "divisive" or "racially insensitive"
instead of arguing that it's false, we should start paying
attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">So another way to figure out which of our taboos future generations
will laugh at is to start with the
labels.</span> <span class="s s87">Take a label-- "sexist", for example-- and try to think
of some ideas that would be called that.</span> <span class="s s88">Then for each ask, might
this be true?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">Just start listing ideas at random?</span> <span class="s s90">Yes, because they
won't really be random.</span> <span class="s s91">The ideas that come to mind first
will be the most plausible ones.</span> <span class="s s92">They'll be things you've already 
noticed but didn't let yourself think.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">In 1989 some clever researchers tracked
the eye movements of radiologists as they scanned chest images for
signs of lung cancer.</span> <span class="s s94">[3] They found that even when the radiologists
missed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it.</span>
<span class="s s95">Part of their brain knew there was something there; it just
didn't percolate all the way up into conscious knowledge.</span> 
<span class="s s96">I think many interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly 
formed in our minds.</span> <span class="s s97">If we turn off our self-censorship
temporarily, those will be the first to emerge.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">Time and Space</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">If we could look into the future it would be obvious which
of our taboos they'd laugh at.</span>
<span class="s s100">We can't do that, but we can do something almost as good: we can
look into the past.</span> <span class="s s101">Another way to figure out what we're
getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable
and is now unthinkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s102">Changes between the past and the present sometimes do represent
progress.</span> <span class="s s103">In a field like physics,
if we disagree with past generations it's because we're
right and they're wrong.</span> <span class="s s104">But this becomes rapidly less true as 
you move away from the certainty of the hard sciences.</span> <span class="s s105">By the time
you get to social questions, many changes are just fashion.</span>
<span class="s s106">The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s107">We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than
past generations, but the more history you read, the less likely
this seems. People in past times were much like us.</span> <span class="s s108">Not heroes,
not barbarians.</span> <span class="s s109">Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas
reasonable people could believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">So here is another source of interesting heresies.</span> <span class="s s111">Diff present
ideas against those of various past cultures, and see what you 
get.</span> <span class="s s112">[4]
Some will be
shocking by present standards.</span> <span class="s s113">Ok, fine; but which might also be true?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">You don't have to look into the past to find big differences.</span> 
<span class="s s115">In our own time, different societies have wildly varying ideas
of what's ok and what isn't.</span>
<span class="s s116">So you can try diffing other cultures' ideas against ours as well.</span>
<span class="s s117">(The best way to do that is to visit them.</span><span class="s s118">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">You might find contradictory taboos.</span> <span class="s s120">In one
culture it might seem shocking to think x, while in another
it was shocking not to.</span> <span class="s s121">But 
I think usually the shock is on one side.</span> <span class="s s122">In one
culture x is ok, and in another it's considered shocking.</span> <span class="s s123">My
hypothesis is that the side
that's shocked is most likely to be the mistaken one.</span>
<span class="s s124">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">I suspect the only taboos that are more than taboos
are the ones that are universal, or nearly so.</span> <span class="s s126">Murder for example.</span>
<span class="s s127">But any idea that's considered harmless in a significant
percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours,
is a good candidate for something we're mistaken
about.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">For example, at the high water mark of political correctness
in the early 1990s, Harvard distributed to its
faculty and staff a brochure saying, among other things, that it
was inappropriate to compliment a colleague or student's
clothes.</span> <span class="s s129">No more "nice shirt.</span><span class="s s130">"</span>
<span class="s s131">I think this principle is rare among the world's cultures, past or present.</span>
<span class="s s132">There are probably more where it's considered especially
polite to compliment someone's clothing than where it's considered
improper.</span>
<span class="s s133">So odds are this is, in a mild form, an example of one of
the taboos a visitor from the future would
have to be careful to avoid if he happened to set his time machine for
Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1992.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">Prigs</span></p>
<p><span class="s s135">Of course, if they have time machines in the future they'll
probably have a separate reference manual just for Cambridge.</span>
<span class="s s136">This has always been a fussy place, a town of i dotters and
t crossers, where you're liable to get both your grammar and 
your ideas corrected in the same conversation.</span> <span class="s s137">And that
suggests another way to find taboos.</span> <span class="s s138">Look for prigs,
and see what's inside their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">Kids' heads are repositories of all our taboos.</span>
<span class="s s140">It seems fitting to us that kids' ideas should be bright and clean.</span>
<span class="s s141">The picture we give them of the world is 
not merely simplified, to suit their developing minds, 
but sanitized as well, to suit our
ideas of what kids ought to think.</span> <span class="s s142">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s143">You can see this on a small scale in the matter of
dirty words.</span> <span class="s s144">A lot of my friends are starting to have children
now, and they're all trying 
not to use words like
"fuck" and "shit" within baby's hearing, lest baby start using 
these words too.</span>
<span class="s s145">But these
words are part of the language, and adults use them all the
time.</span> <span class="s s146">So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of 
the language by not using
them.</span> <span class="s s147">Why do they do this?</span> <span class="s s148">Because they don't think it's
fitting that kids should use the whole language.</span> <span class="s s149">We like
children to seem innocent.</span> <span class="s s150">[7]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s151">Most adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a misleading
view of the world.</span>
<span class="s s152">One of the most obvious
examples is Santa Claus.</span> <span class="s s153">We think it's cute for little kids to
believe in Santa Claus.</span> <span class="s s154">I myself think it's cute for little
kids to believe in Santa Claus.</span> <span class="s s155">But one wonders, do we tell
them this stuff for their sake, or for ours?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s156">I'm not arguing for or against this idea here.</span> <span class="s s157">It is probably
inevitable that parents should want to dress up their kids'
minds in cute little baby outfits.</span> <span class="s s158">I'll probably do it myself.</span>
<span class="s s159">The important thing for our purposes is that, as a result,
a well brought-up teenage kid's brain is a more
or less complete collection of all our taboos-- and in mint
condition, because they're untainted by experience.</span> 
<span class="s s160">Whatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, 
it's almost certainly inside that head.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">How do we get at these ideas?</span> <span class="s s162">By the following thought experiment.</span>
<span class="s s163">Imagine a kind of latter-day Conrad character
who has worked for a time as a mercenary in Africa, for a time
as a doctor in Nepal, for a time as the manager of a
nightclub in Miami.</span> <span class="s s164">The specifics don't matter-- just
someone who has
seen a lot.</span> <span class="s s165">Now imagine comparing what's inside this guy's head
with what's inside the head
of a well-behaved sixteen year old girl from
the suburbs.</span> <span class="s s166">What does he think that
would shock her?</span>
<span class="s s167">He knows the world; she knows, or at least embodies, present
taboos.</span> <span class="s s168">Subtract one from the other, and the result is what
we can't say.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s170">Mechanism</span></p>
<p><span class="s s171">I can think of one more way to figure out what we can't
say: to look at how taboos are created.</span> <span class="s s172">How do moral
fashions arise, and why are they adopted?</span>
<span class="s s173">If we can understand this mechanism, we
may be able to see it at work in our own time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">Moral fashions don't seem to be created the way ordinary
fashions are.</span> <span class="s s175">Ordinary fashions seem to arise by accident when
everyone imitates the whim of some influential person.</span>
<span class="s s176">The fashion for broad-toed shoes in
late fifteenth century Europe began because Charles VIII of
France had six toes on one foot.</span> <span class="s s177">The fashion for the
name Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper adopted the name
of a tough mill town in Indiana.</span> <span class="s s178">Moral fashions more often
seem to be created deliberately.</span> <span class="s s179">When there's something we
can't say, it's often because some group doesn't want us to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous.</span> 
<span class="s s181">The irony of Galileo's situation was that he got in trouble
for repeating Copernicus's ideas.</span> <span class="s s182">Copernicus himself didn't.</span>
<span class="s s183">In fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his
book to the pope.</span> <span class="s s184">But by Galileo's time the church was in
the throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more
worried about unorthodox ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s185">To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between
weakness and power.</span> <span class="s s186">A confident group doesn't need taboos
to protect it.</span> <span class="s s187">It's not considered improper to
make disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English.</span>
<span class="s s188">And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a
taboo.</span> <span class="s s189">Coprophiles, as of this writing, don't seem to be
numerous or energetic enough to have had their
interests promoted to a lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s190">I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to
be power struggles in which one side only barely has
the upper hand.</span> <span class="s s191">That's where you'll find a group
powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">Most struggles, whatever they're really about, will be cast
as struggles between competing ideas.</span>
<span class="s s193">The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power,
but it ended up being
cast as a struggle to preserve the souls
of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome.</span>
<span class="s s194">It's easier to get people to fight for an idea.</span>
<span class="s s195">And whichever side wins, their
ideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if God
wanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s196">We often like to think of World War II as a triumph
of freedom over totalitarianism.</span> <span class="s s197">We conveniently forget that
the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">I'm not saying that struggles are never about ideas,
just that they will always be made to seem to be about
ideas, whether they are or not.</span> <span class="s s199">And just as there is nothing
so unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion, there is
nothing so wrong as the principles of the most recently
defeated opponent.</span>

<span class="s s200">Representational art is only now
recovering from the approval of both Hitler and Stalin.</span> <span class="s s201">[8]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s202">Although moral fashions tend to arise from different sources
than fashions in clothing, the mechanism of their adoption seems
much the same.</span> <span class="s s203">The early adopters will be driven by ambition:
self-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselves
from the common herd.</span> <span class="s s204">As the fashion becomes established they'll
be joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear.</span> <span class="s s205">[9] This
second group adopt the fashion not because they want to stand
out but because they are afraid of standing out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s206">So if you want to figure out what we can't say, look at the
machinery of fashion and try to predict what it would make
unsayable.</span> <span class="s s207">What groups are powerful but nervous, and what
ideas would they like to suppress?</span> <span class="s s208">What ideas were tarnished by
association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent
struggle?</span> <span class="s s209">If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate
himself from preceding fashions (e.</span><span class="s s210">g.</span> <span class="s s211">from his parents), 
which of their ideas would he tend to reject?</span>
<span class="s s212">What are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">This technique won't find us all the things we can't say.</span>
<span class="s s214">I can think of some that aren't the result of
any recent struggle.</span> <span class="s s215">Many of our taboos are rooted
deep in the past.</span> <span class="s s216">But this approach, combined with the
preceding four, will turn up a good number of unthinkable
ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s217">Why</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">Some would ask, why would one want to do this? Why deliberately
go poking around among nasty, disreputable ideas? Why look 
under rocks?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">I do it, first of all, for the same reason I did look under
rocks as a kid: plain curiosity.</span> <span class="s s220">And I'm especially curious about
anything that's forbidden.</span> <span class="s s221">Let me see and decide for myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s222">Second, I do it because I don't like the idea of being mistaken.</span>
<span class="s s223">If, like other eras, we believe things that will later seem ridiculous,
I want to know what they are so that I, at least, can avoid
believing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s224">Third, I do it because it's good for the brain.</span> <span class="s s225">To do good work
you need a brain that can go anywhere.</span> <span class="s s226">And you especially need a
brain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s227">Great work tends to grow out of ideas
that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that's
unthinkable.</span>
<span class="s s228">Natural selection, for example.</span>
<span class="s s229">It's so simple.</span> <span class="s s230">Why didn't anyone think of it before?</span> <span class="s s231">Well,
that is all too obvious.</span> <span class="s s232">Darwin himself was careful to tiptoe
around the implications of his theory.</span> <span class="s s233">He wanted to spend his
time thinking about biology, not arguing with people who accused
him of being an atheist.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s234">In the sciences, especially, it's a great advantage to be able to
question assumptions.</span>
<span class="s s235">The m.</span><span class="s s236">o.</span> <span class="s s237">of scientists, or at least of the
good ones, is precisely that: look for places where
conventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the
cracks and see what's underneath.</span> <span class="s s238">That's where new theories come
from.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s239">A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignore
conventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it.</span>
<span class="s s240">Scientists go looking for trouble.</span>
<span class="s s241">This should be the m.</span><span class="s s242">o.</span> <span class="s s243">of any scholar, but 
scientists seem much more willing to look under rocks.</span> <span class="s s244">[10]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s245">Why?</span> <span class="s s246">It could
be that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could,
if necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature,
but few professors of French literature could make it through
a PhD program in physics.</span> <span class="s s247">Or it could be because it's clearer
in the sciences whether theories are true or false, and this
makes scientists bolder.</span> <span class="s s248">(Or it could be that, because it's
clearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, you
have to be smart to get jobs as a scientist, rather than just a
good politician.</span><span class="s s249">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s250">Whatever the reason, there seems a clear correlation between
intelligence and willingness to consider shocking ideas.</span>
<span class="s s251">This isn't just because smart people actively work to find holes in
conventional thinking.</span> <span class="s s252">I think conventions also have
less hold over them to start with.</span>
<span class="s s253">You can see that in the
way they dress.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s254">It's not only in the sciences that heresy pays off.</span>
<span class="s s255">In any competitive field, you can
win big by seeing things that others daren't.</span> 
<span class="s s256">And in every
field there are probably heresies few dare utter.</span> <span class="s s257">Within
the US car industry there is a lot of hand-wringing now
about declining market share.</span>
<span class="s s258">Yet the cause is so obvious that any observant outsider could
explain it in a second: they make bad cars.</span> <span class="s s259">And they have for
so long that by now the US car brands are antibrands-- something
you'd buy a car despite, not because of.</span> <span class="s s260">Cadillac stopped
being the Cadillac of cars in about 1970.</span> <span class="s s261">And yet I suspect
no one dares say this.</span> <span class="s s262">[11] Otherwise these companies would have
tried to fix the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s263">Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages
beyond the thoughts themselves.</span> <span class="s s264">It's like stretching.</span>
<span class="s s265">When you stretch before running, you put your body into positions
much more extreme
than any it will assume during the run.</span>
<span class="s s266">If you can think things
so outside the box that they'd make people's hair stand on end,
you'll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that
people call innovative.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s267">Pensieri Stretti</span></p>
<p><span class="s s268">When you find something you can't say, what do you do with it?
My advice is, don't say it. Or at least, pick your battles.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s269">Suppose in the future there is a movement to ban
the color yellow.</span> <span class="s s270">Proposals to paint anything yellow are
denounced as "yellowist", as is anyone suspected of liking the 
color.</span> <span class="s s271">People who like orange are tolerated but viewed with
suspicion.</span> <span class="s s272">Suppose you realize there is nothing
wrong with yellow.</span> <span class="s s273">If you go around saying this, you'll be
denounced as a yellowist too, and you'll find yourself having a 
lot of arguments with anti-yellowists.</span>
<span class="s s274">If your aim in life is to rehabilitate the color yellow, that may
be what you want.</span>
<span class="s s275">But if you're mostly interested in
other questions, being labelled as a yellowist will just be
a distraction.</span> <span class="s s276">Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s277">The most important thing is to be able to think what you
want, not to say what you want.</span> <span class="s s278">And if you feel you have to
say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking 
improper thoughts.</span> <span class="s s279">I think it's better to follow the opposite
policy.</span> <span class="s s280">Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your
speech.</span> <span class="s s281">Inside your head, anything is allowed.</span>
<span class="s s282">Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous
thoughts I can imagine.</span> 
<span class="s s283">But, as in
a secret society, nothing that happens within the building
should be told to outsiders.</span> <span class="s s284">The first rule of Fight
Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s285">When Milton was going to visit Italy in the 1630s,
Sir Henry Wootton, who had been ambassador to Venice, told him
his motto should be
"i pensieri stretti &amp; il viso sciolto.</span><span class="s s286">"</span> <span class="s s287">Closed thoughts
and an open face.</span> <span class="s s288">Smile at everyone, and don't tell them
what you're thinking.</span> <span class="s s289">This was wise advice.</span>
<span class="s s290">Milton was an argumentative fellow, and the Inquisition
was a bit restive at that time.</span> <span class="s s291">But I think the difference 
between Milton's situation and ours is only a matter of
degree.</span>
<span class="s s292">Every era has its heresies, and if you don't get imprisoned for them you
will at least get in enough trouble that it becomes a complete
distraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s293">I admit it seems cowardly to keep quiet.</span>
<span class="s s294">When I read about the harassment to which
the Scientologists subject their critics [12], or that pro-Israel groups
are "compiling dossiers" on those who speak out against Israeli
human rights abuses [13], or about people being sued for
violating the DMCA [14], part of me wants
to say, "All right, you bastards, bring it on.</span><span class="s s295">"</span>
<span class="s s296">The problem is, there are so many things you can't say.</span>
<span class="s s297">If you said them all you'd 
have no time left for your real work.</span>
<span class="s s298">You'd have to turn into Noam Chomsky.</span> <span class="s s299">[15]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s300">The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though,
is that you lose the advantages of discussion.</span> <span class="s s301">Talking
about an idea leads to more ideas.</span>
<span class="s s302">So the optimal plan, if you can manage it,
is to have a few trusted
friends you can speak openly to.</span> <span class="s s303">This is not just a
way to develop ideas; it's also a good
rule of thumb for choosing friends.</span> <span class="s s304">The people
you can say heretical things to without getting jumped on
are also the most interesting to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s305">Viso Sciolto?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s306">I don't think we need
the viso sciolto so much as the pensieri stretti.</span>
<span class="s s307">Perhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don't
agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but
not to be too specific about what you disagree with.</span> <span class="s s308">Zealots
will try to draw you out, but you don't have to answer them.</span>
<span class="s s309">If they try to force you to treat a question on their
terms by asking "are you with us or against us?</span><span class="s s310">"</span> <span class="s s311">you can
always just answer "neither".</span></p>
<p><span class="s s312">Better still, answer "I haven't decided.</span><span class="s s313">"</span>
<span class="s s314">That's what Larry Summers
did when a group tried to put
him in this position.</span> <span class="s s315">Explaining himself later, he said
"I don't do litmus tests.</span><span class="s s316">"</span> <span class="s s317">[16]
A lot of the
questions people get hot about are actually quite complicated.</span>
<span class="s s318">There is no prize for getting the answer quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s319">If the anti-yellowists seem to be getting out of hand and
you want to fight back, there are ways
to do it without getting yourself accused of being a
yellowist.</span> <span class="s s320">Like skirmishers in
an ancient army, you want to avoid directly engaging the
main body of the enemy's troops.</span> <span class="s s321">Better to harass them
with arrows from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s322">One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level of
abstraction.</span>
<span class="s s323">If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being
accused of whatever heresy is contained
in the book or film that someone is trying to censor.</span>
<span class="s s324">You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that refer
to the use of labels to prevent discussion.</span>
<span class="s s325">The spread of the term "political correctness" meant the beginning of
the end of political correctness, because it enabled one to
attack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of any
of the specific heresies it sought to suppress.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s326">Another way to counterattack is with metaphor.</span> <span class="s s327">Arthur Miller
undermined the House Un-American Activities Committee
by writing a play, "The Crucible," about the Salem witch trials.</span>
<span class="s s328">He never referred directly to the committee and so gave them
no way to reply.</span>
<span class="s s329">What could HUAC do, defend the Salem witch trials?</span> <span class="s s330">And yet
Miller's metaphor stuck so well that to this day the activities
of the committee are often described as a "witch-hunt.</span><span class="s s331">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s332">Best of all, probably, is humor.</span> <span class="s s333">Zealots, whatever their 
cause, invariably lack a sense of humor.</span>
<span class="s s334">They can't reply in kind to jokes.</span>
<span class="s s335">They're as unhappy on the territory of
humor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.</span>
<span class="s s336">Victorian prudishness, for example, seems to have been defeated
mainly by treating it as a joke.</span> <span class="s s337">Likewise its reincarnation as
political correctness.</span>
<span class="s s338">"I am glad that I
managed to write 'The Crucible,'" Arthur Miller wrote,
"but looking back I have often wished I'd
had the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what the
situation deserved.</span><span class="s s339">"</span> <span class="s s340">[17]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s341">ABQ</span></p>
<p><span class="s s342">A Dutch friend says
I should use Holland as an example of a tolerant society.</span>
<span class="s s343">It's true they have a long tradition of
comparative open-mindedness.</span> <span class="s s344">For centuries the low countries were the place
to go to say things you couldn't say anywhere else,
and this helped to make the region a center of scholarship and industry
(which have been closely tied for longer than most people realize).</span>
<span class="s s345">Descartes, though claimed by the French, did much of his thinking in
Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s346">And yet, I wonder.</span> <span class="s s347">The Dutch seem to live their lives up to their
necks in rules and regulations.</span> <span class="s s348">There's so much you can't do there;
is there really nothing
you can't say?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s349">Certainly the fact that they value open-mindedness is no guarantee.</span>
<span class="s s350">Who thinks they're not open-minded?</span> <span class="s s351">Our hypothetical prim miss from
the suburbs thinks she's open-minded.</span> <span class="s s352">Hasn't she been
taught to be?</span> <span class="s s353">Ask anyone, and they'll say the same thing: they're
pretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really
wrong.</span> <span class="s s354">(Some tribes
may avoid "wrong" as
judgemental, and may instead use a more neutral sounding euphemism
like "negative" or "destructive".</span><span class="s s355">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s356">When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the
wrong answers on tests.</span> <span class="s s357">But when people are bad at open-mindedness
they don't know it.</span> <span class="s s358">In fact they tend to think the opposite.</span>
<span class="s s359">Remember, it's the nature of fashion to be invisible.</span> <span class="s s360">It wouldn't
work otherwise.</span> <span class="s s361">Fashion doesn't
seem like fashion to someone in the grip of it.</span> <span class="s s362">It just seems like
the right thing to do.</span> <span class="s s363">It's only by looking from a distance that
we see oscillations in people's idea of the right thing to do, and
can identify them as fashions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s364">Time gives us such distance for free.</span> <span class="s s365">Indeed, the arrival of new
fashions makes old fashions easy to see, because they
seem so ridiculous by contrast.</span> <span class="s s366">From one end of a pendulum's
swing, the other end seems especially far away.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s367">To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort.</span>
<span class="s s368">Without time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself.</span>
<span class="s s369">Instead of being part of the mob, stand
as far away from it as you can and watch what it's
doing.</span> <span class="s s370">And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being
suppressed.</span> <span class="s s371">Web filters for children and employees often ban
sites containing pornography, violence, and hate speech.</span> <span class="s s372">What
counts as pornography and violence?</span> <span class="s s373">And what, exactly, is
"hate speech?</span><span class="s s374">"</span> <span class="s s375">This sounds like a phrase out of 1984.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s376">Labels like that are probably the biggest external clue.</span>
<span class="s s377">If a statement is false,
that's the worst thing you can say about it.</span> <span class="s s378">You don't
need to say that it's heretical.</span> <span class="s s379">And if it isn't false, it
shouldn't be suppressed.</span> <span class="s s380">So when you see statements being
attacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your current values of
x and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that's a sure sign that
something is wrong.</span> <span class="s s381">When you hear such labels being used,
ask why.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s382">Especially if you hear yourself using them.</span> <span class="s s383">It's not just
the mob you need to learn to watch from a distance.</span> <span class="s s384">You need to be
able to watch your own thoughts from a distance.</span> <span class="s s385">That's not
a radical idea, by the way; it's the main difference between
children and adults.</span> <span class="s s386">When a child gets angry because he's
tired, he doesn't know what's happening.</span> <span class="s s387">An adult can
distance himself enough from the
situation to say "never mind, I'm just tired.</span><span class="s s388">"</span> <span class="s s389">I don't
see why one couldn't, by a similar process, learn to
recognize and discount the effects of moral fashions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s390">You have to take that extra step if you want to think clearly.</span>
<span class="s s391">But it's harder, because now you're working against social customs 
instead of with them.</span> <span class="s s392">Everyone encourages you to grow up to the 
point where you can discount your own bad moods.</span> <span class="s s393">Few encourage 
you to continue to the point where you can discount society's bad
moods.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s394">How can you see the wave, when you're the water? Always be
questioning. That's the only defence. What can't you say? And why?</span></p>
