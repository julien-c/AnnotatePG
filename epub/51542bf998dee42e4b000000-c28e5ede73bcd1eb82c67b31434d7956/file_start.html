  <h2><span class="s s1">How to Start a Startup</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
March 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer
Society.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with
good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend
as little money as possible.</span> <span class="s s5">Most startups that fail do it because
they fail at one of these.</span> <span class="s s6">A startup that does all three will
probably succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all
three are doable.</span> <span class="s s8">Hard, but doable.</span> <span class="s s9">And since a startup that
succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting
rich is doable too.</span> <span class="s s10">Hard, but doable.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">If there is one message I'd like to get across about startups,
that's it.</span> <span class="s s12">There is no magically difficult step that requires
brilliance to solve.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">The Idea</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">In particular, you don't need a brilliant 
idea to start a startup
around.</span> <span class="s s15">The way a startup makes money is to offer people better
technology than they have now.</span> <span class="s s16">But what people have now is often
so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that
didn't suck.</span> <span class="s s18">They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use
links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with
unintrusive keyword-based ads.</span> <span class="s s19">Above all, they were determined to
make a site that was good to use.</span> <span class="s s20">No doubt there are great technical
tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward.</span>
<span class="s s21">And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings
them a billion dollars a year.</span> <span class="s s22">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search
was before Google.</span> <span class="s s24">I can think of several heuristics for generating
ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something
people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that
doesn't suck.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did
before Google.</span> <span class="s s26">They all use the same simple-minded model.</span>
<span class="s s27">They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to
do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world.</span>
<span class="s s28">An undergrad could build something better as a class project.</span> <span class="s s29">And
yet there's a lot of money at stake.</span> <span class="s s30">Online dating is a valuable
business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it
worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning.</span> <span class="s s32">A lot of
would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the
initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute.</span>
<span class="s s33">Venture capitalists know better.</span> <span class="s s34">If you go to VC firms with a
brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure
agreement, most will tell you to get lost.</span> <span class="s s35">That shows how much a 
mere idea is worth.</span> <span class="s s36">The market price is less than the inconvenience 
of signing an NDA.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number
of startups that change their plan en route.</span> <span class="s s38">Microsoft's original
plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things.</span>
<span class="s s39">Their current business model didn't occur to them until IBM dropped
it in their lap five years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble
is, they're not transferrable.</span> <span class="s s41">They're not something you could
hand to someone else to execute.</span> <span class="s s42">Their value is mainly as starting
points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking
about.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good
people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people. 
</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">People</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">What do I mean by good people?</span> <span class="s s46">One of the best tricks I learned 
during our startup was a rule for deciding 
who to hire.</span> <span class="s s47">Could you
describe the person as an animal?</span> <span class="s s48">It might be hard to translate 
that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows 
what it means.</span> <span class="s s49">It means someone who takes their work a little too 
seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass
right through professional and cross over into obsessive.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who
just won't take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 
4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR 
person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell
phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something 
is two millimeters out of place.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did.</span> 
<span class="s s52">The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel
sorry for potential customers on the phone with her.</span> <span class="s s53">You could 
sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no 
rest for them till they'd signed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">If you think about people you know, you'll find the animal test is
easy to apply.</span> <span class="s s55">Call the person's image to mind and imagine the
sentence "so-and-so is an animal.</span><span class="s s56">"</span> <span class="s s57">If you laugh, they're not.</span> <span class="s s58">You
don't need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but
you need it in a startup.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">For programmers we had three additional tests.</span> <span class="s s60">Was the person
genuinely smart?</span> <span class="s s61">If so, could they actually get things done?</span> <span class="s s62">And
finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, 
could we stand to have them around?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">That last test filters out surprisingly few people.</span> <span class="s s64">We could bear
any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart.</span> <span class="s s65">What we couldn't
stand were people with a lot of attitude.</span> <span class="s s66">But most of those weren't
truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the
first.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">When nerds are unbearable it's usually because they're trying too
hard to seem smart.</span> <span class="s s68">But the smarter they are, the less pressure
they feel to act smart.</span> <span class="s s69">So as a rule you can recognize genuinely
smart people by their ability to say things like "I don't know," 
"Maybe you're right," and "I don't understand x well enough.</span><span class="s s70">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">This technique doesn't always work, because people can be influenced
by their environment.</span> <span class="s s72">In the MIT CS department, there seems to be
a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all.</span> <span class="s s73">I'm told it derives
ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline
pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager.</span> <span class="s s74">Even genuinely
smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make
allowances.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to
say "I don't know" of anyone I've met.</span> <span class="s s76">(At least, he was before he 
became a professor at MIT.</span><span class="s s77">) No one dared put on attitude around 
Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had
zero attitude himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s78">Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was
through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired.</span>
<span class="s s79">This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies.</span>
<span class="s s80">Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you 
more than companies could ever learn in interviews.</span> <span class="s s81">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">It's no coincidence that startups start around universities, because
that's where smart people meet.</span> <span class="s s83">It's not what people learn in 
classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies
spring up around them.</span> <span class="s s84">They could sing campfire songs in the classes
so long as admissions worked the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">If you start a startup, there's a good chance it will be with people
you know from college or grad school.</span> <span class="s s86">So in theory you ought to 
try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school,
right?</span> <span class="s s87">Well, no.</span> <span class="s s88">Don't make a conscious effort to schmooze; that
doesn't work well with hackers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">What you should do in college is work on your own projects.</span> <span class="s s90">Hackers
should do this even if they don't plan to start startups, because 
it's the only real way to learn how to program.</span> <span class="s s91">In some cases you
may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to
get to know good hackers.</span> <span class="s s92">The project may even grow into a startup.</span>
<span class="s s93">But once again, I wouldn't aim too directly at either target.</span> <span class="s s94">Don't
force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">Ideally you want between two and four founders.</span> <span class="s s96">It would be hard
to start with just one.</span> <span class="s s97">One person would find the moral weight of
starting a company hard to bear.</span> <span class="s s98">Even Bill Gates, who seems to be 
able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder.</span> 
<span class="s s99">But you don't want so many founders that the company starts to look
like a group photo.</span> <span class="s s100">Partly because you don't need a lot of people
at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse
disagreements you'll have.</span> <span class="s s101">When there are just two or three founders,
you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish.</span> <span class="s s102">If
there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into
factions.</span> <span class="s s103">You don't want mere voting; you need unanimity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s104">In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders
should include technical people.</span> <span class="s s105">During the Internet Bubble there 
were a number of startups founded by business people who then went
looking for hackers to create their product for them.</span> <span class="s s106">This doesn't 
work well.</span> <span class="s s107">Business people are bad at deciding what to do with 
technology, because they don't know what the options are, or which
kinds of problems are hard and which are easy.</span> <span class="s s108">And when business
people try to hire hackers, they can't tell which ones are 
good.</span>
<span class="s s109">Even other hackers have a hard time doing that.</span> 
<span class="s s110">For business people it's roulette.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s111">Do the founders of a startup have to include business people?</span> <span class="s s112">That
depends.</span> <span class="s s113">We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several 
people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called
"business" if they would be the president.</span> <span class="s s114">But they all said no,
so I had to do it myself.</span> <span class="s s115">And what I discovered was that business
was no great mystery.</span> <span class="s s116">It's not something like physics or medicine
that requires extensive study.</span> <span class="s s117">You just try to get people to pay
you for stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was
disgusted by the idea of doing it.</span> <span class="s s119">I wanted to work in the pure, 
intellectual world of software, not deal with customers' mundane 
problems. People who don't want to get dragged into some kind of
work often develop a protective incompetence at it.</span> <span class="s s120">Paul Erdos was
particularly good at this.</span> <span class="s s121">By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit
in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other
people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for
math.</span> <span class="s s122">Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same 
trick to some degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s123">Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found
that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared.</span> <span class="s s124">There
are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law
or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about 
those in a startup.</span> <span class="s s125">All you need to know about business to run a 
startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business
schools, or even universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the 
name of each person with an MBA, you'll learn something important
about business school.</span> <span class="s s127">After Warren Buffett, you don't hit another 
MBA till number 22,
Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike.</span> <span class="s s128">There are only 5 MBAs in the top
50.</span> <span class="s s129">What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with 
technical backgrounds.</span> <span class="s s130">Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,
Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore.</span> <span class="s s131">The rulers of the technology
business tend to come from technology, not business.</span> <span class="s s132">So if you 
want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed 
in business, the evidence suggests you'd do better to learn how to 
hack than get an MBA.</span> <span class="s s133">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">There is one reason you might want to include business people in a
startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing
and able to focus on what customers want.</span> <span class="s s135">Some believe only business
people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not 
design it.</span> <span class="s s136">That's nonsense.</span> <span class="s s137">There's nothing about knowing how to
program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about
not knowing how to program that magically enables business people 
to understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s138">If you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how
or find a co-founder who can.</span> <span class="s s139">That is the single most important
issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them
than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s140">What Customers Want</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">It's not just startups that have to worry about this.</span> <span class="s s142">I think most
businesses that fail do it because they don't give customers what
they want.</span> <span class="s s143">Look at restaurants.</span> <span class="s s144">A large percentage fail, about a
quarter in the first year.</span> <span class="s s145">But can you think of one restaurant
that had really good food and went out of business?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s146">Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.</span> <span class="s s147">A 
restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy,
out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep
coming.</span> <span class="s s148">It's true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes 
attract customers through gimmicks.</span> <span class="s s149">But that approach is very 
risky.</span> <span class="s s150">It's more straightforward just to make the food good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s151">It's the same with technology.</span> <span class="s s152">You hear all kinds of reasons why
startups fail.</span> <span class="s s153">But can you think of one that had a massively popular
product and still failed?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s154">In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers
didn't want the product.</span> <span class="s s155">For most, the cause of death is listed 
as "ran out of funding," but that's only the immediate cause.</span> <span class="s s156">Why 
couldn't they get more funding?</span> <span class="s s157">Probably because the product was
a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s158">When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to 
do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you
can.</span> <span class="s s159">But I decided not to, because that's implicit in making
something customers want.</span> <span class="s s160">The only way to make something customers
want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on 
their reactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">The other approach is what I call the "Hail Mary" strategy.</span> <span class="s s162">You 
make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to 
develop it (people who do this tend to use the term "engineer" for 
hackers), and then find after a year that you've spent two million
dollars to develop something no one wants.</span> <span class="s s163">This was not uncommon
during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, 
who thought of software development as something terrifying that
therefore had to be carefully planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s164">We never even considered that approach.</span> <span class="s s165">As a Lisp hacker, I come 
from the tradition of rapid prototyping.</span> <span class="s s166">I would not claim (at
least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program,
but it's certainly the right way to write software for a startup.</span>
<span class="s s167">In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in
some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where.</span> 
<span class="s s168">The only way to do that is to try implementing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly.</span> <span class="s s170">At first we
expected our customers to be Web consultants.</span> <span class="s s171">But it turned out
they didn't like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted
the site.</span> <span class="s s172">It would be too easy for clients to fire them.</span> <span class="s s173">We also
thought we'd be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because
selling online was a natural extension of their existing business.</span>
<span class="s s174">But in 1996 that was a hard sell.</span> <span class="s s175">The middle managers we talked 
to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as
something that meant more work for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s176">We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies.</span> <span class="s s177">Among
them was Frederick's of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience
dealing with heavy loads on our servers.</span> <span class="s s178">But most of our users 
were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity 
to build a business.</span> <span class="s s179">Some had retail stores, but many only existed
online.</span> <span class="s s180">And so we changed direction to focus on these users.</span>
<span class="s s181">Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog
companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">I learned something valuable from that.</span> <span class="s s183">It's worth trying very, 
very hard to make technology easy to use.</span> <span class="s s184">Hackers are so used to
computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to
normal people.</span> <span class="s s185">Stephen Hawking's editor told him that every equation
he included in his book would cut sales in half.</span> <span class="s s186">When you work on
making technology easier to use, you're riding that curve up instead 
of down.</span> <span class="s s187">A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn't just increase 
your sales 10%.</span> <span class="s s188">It's more likely to double your sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">How do you figure out what customers want?</span> <span class="s s190">Watch them.</span> <span class="s s191">One of the
best places to do this was at trade shows.</span> <span class="s s192">Trade shows didn't pay 
as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market
research.</span> <span class="s s193">We didn't just give canned presentations at trade shows.</span>
<span class="s s194">We used to show people how to build real, working stores.</span> <span class="s s195">Which 
meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them 
about what they needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s196">No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a 
stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.</span> <span class="s s197">The
only kind of software you can build without studying users is the 
sort for which you are the typical user.</span> <span class="s s198">But this is just the kind
that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming
languages, editors, and so on.</span> <span class="s s199">So if you're developing technology
for money, you're probably not going to be developing it for people
like you.</span> <span class="s s200">Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for
startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s201">When most people think of startups, they think of companies like
Apple or Google.</span> <span class="s s202">Everyone knows these, because they're big consumer
brands.</span> <span class="s s203">But for every startup like that, there are twenty more 
that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure.</span>
<span class="s s204">So if you start a successful startup, odds are you'll start one of 
those.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s205">Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup
that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding
are steeper.</span> <span class="s s206">The best odds are in niche markets.</span> <span class="s s207">Since startups 
make money by offering people something better than they had before,
the best opportunities are where things suck most.</span> <span class="s s208">And it would 
be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate 
IT departments.</span> <span class="s s209">You would not believe the amount of money companies
spend on software, and the crap they get in return.</span> <span class="s s210">This imbalance
equals opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s211">If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you
could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a 
couple weeks just watching what they do with computers.</span> <span class="s s212">Most good
hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places
than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it's easier
to sell to them.</span> <span class="s s214">It's worth so much to sell stuff to big companies
that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a
lot of time and money to do it.</span> <span class="s s215">And while you can outhack Oracle
with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can't outsell an
Oracle salesman.</span> <span class="s s216">So if you want to win through better technology,
aim at smaller customers.</span> <span class="s s217">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">They're the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway.</span> 
<span class="s s219">In technology, the low end always eats the high end.</span> <span class="s s220">It's easier 
to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful
product cheaper.</span> <span class="s s221">So the products that start as cheap, simple options
tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a 
room, they squash the "high-end" products against the ceiling.</span> <span class="s s222">Sun
did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun.</span> <span class="s s223">Microsoft
Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and
Framemaker.</span> <span class="s s224">Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive
models made for professionals.</span> <span class="s s225">Avid did it to the manufacturers 
of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to
Avid.</span> <span class="s s226">Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded
him.</span> <span class="s s227">If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you'll not only
find it easier to sell at first, but you'll also be in the best 
position to conquer the rest of the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s228">It's very dangerous to let anyone fly under you.</span> <span class="s s229">If you have the
cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end.</span> <span class="s s230">And if you
don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s231">Raising Money</span></p>
<p><span class="s s232">To make all this happen, you're going to need money.</span> <span class="s s233">Some startups
have been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren't.</span>
<span class="s s234">I think it's wise to take money from investors.</span> <span class="s s235">To be self-funding,
you have to start as a consulting company, and it's hard to switch
from that to a product company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s236">Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course.</span> <span class="s s237">The way to get
rich from a startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding,
not to maximize the amount of stock you retain.</span> <span class="s s238">So if you can trade
stock for something that improves your odds, it's probably a smart 
move.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s239">To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and
mysterious process.</span> <span class="s s240">Actually it's merely tedious.</span> <span class="s s241">I'll try to
give an outline of how it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s242">The first thing you'll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars 
to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.</span> <span class="s s243">This is called
seed capital.</span> <span class="s s244">Because so little money is involved, raising seed
capital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a
quick yes or no.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s245">Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called
"angels.</span><span class="s s246">"</span> <span class="s s247">Often they're people who themselves got rich from technology.</span>
<span class="s s248">At the seed stage, investors don't expect you to have an elaborate
business plan.</span> <span class="s s249">Most know that they're supposed to decide quickly.</span>
<span class="s s250">It's not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page
agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s251">We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian.</span>
<span class="s s252">But he gave us a lot more than money.</span> <span class="s s253">He's a former CEO and also
a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about
business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as
a company.</span> <span class="s s254">Plus he introduced us to one of the two 
angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s255">Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be 
satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to 
do.</span> <span class="s s256">But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to
remind themselves what they invested in.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s257">Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I'm amazed how much
worry it caused me.</span> <span class="s s258">"Business plan" has that word "business" in
it, so I figured it had to be something I'd have to read a book
about business plans to write.</span> <span class="s s259">Well, it doesn't.</span> <span class="s s260">At this stage,
all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan 
to do and how you're going to make money from it, and the resumes 
of the founders.</span> <span class="s s261">If you just sit down and write out what you've
been saying to one another, that should be fine.</span> <span class="s s262">It shouldn't take
more than a couple hours, and you'll probably find that writing it
all down gives you more ideas about what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s263">For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you're going
to have to have some kind of company.</span> <span class="s s264">Merely incorporating yourselves
isn't hard.</span> <span class="s s265">The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to
decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.</span> <span class="s s266">If
there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both
equally committed to the business, that's easy.</span> <span class="s s267">But if you have a
number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees,
arranging the proportions of stock can be hard.</span> <span class="s s268">And once you've
done it, it tends to be set in stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s269">I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.</span> <span class="s s270">All I can say is,
try hard to do it right.</span> <span class="s s271">I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing
when you have, though.</span> <span class="s s272">When everyone feels they're getting a
slightly bad deal, that they're doing more than they should for the
amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s273">There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of
course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation, 
various things with the IRS.</span> <span class="s s274">I'm not even sure what the list is,
because we, ah, skipped all that.</span> <span class="s s275">When we got real funding near
the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything 
retroactively.</span> <span class="s s276">It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if
you don't do everything you're supposed to when starting a company.</span>
<span class="s s277">And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started.</span>
<span class="s s278">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s279">It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because
one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start 
another company doing the same thing.</span> <span class="s s280">This does happen.</span> <span class="s s281">So when
you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you
should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone's
ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be
everyone's only job.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s282">[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s283">While you're at it, you should ask what else they've signed.</span> <span class="s s284">One
of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into 
intellectual property problems. We did, and it came closer to 
killing us than any competitor ever did.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s285">As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one
of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said
all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him
to go to grad school.</span> <span class="s s286">In theory, that could have meant someone
else owned big chunks of our software.</span> <span class="s s287">So the acquisition came to
a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out.</span> <span class="s s288">The problem 
was, since we'd been about to be acquired, we'd allowed ourselves 
to run low on cash.</span> <span class="s s289">Now we needed to raise more to keep going.</span> 
<span class="s s290">But it's hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because
investors can't judge how serious it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s291">Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere
else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I
will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word 
"angel" is a metaphor.</span> <span class="s s292">The founders thereupon proposed to walk 
away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial 
on how to administer the servers themselves.</span> <span class="s s293">And while this was
happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on 
the deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s294">Miraculously it all turned out ok.</span> <span class="s s295">The investors backed down; we
did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant
company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn't own our
software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much
more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay.</span> <span class="s s296">So we were happy
in the end, though the experience probably took several years off 
my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s297">Don't do what we did. Before you consummate a startup, ask 
everyone about their previous IP history.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s298">Once you've got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go
knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens
of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch 
of guys with some ideas.</span> <span class="s s299">But when you look at it from the rich
people's point of view, the picture is more encouraging.</span> <span class="s s300">Most rich 
people are looking for good investments.</span> <span class="s s301">If you really think you
have a chance of succeeding, you're doing them a favor by letting
them invest.</span> <span class="s s302">Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being 
approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s303">Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders.</span> <span class="s s304">They get 
the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future
rounds.</span> <span class="s s305">How much stock should they get?</span> <span class="s s306">That depends on how
ambitious you feel.</span> <span class="s s307">When you offer x percent of your company for
y dollars, you're implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole
company.</span> <span class="s s308">Venture investments are usually described in terms of
that number.</span> <span class="s s309">If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of
those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you've done
the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s310">How do you decide what the value of the company should be?</span> <span class="s s311">There
is no rational way.</span> <span class="s s312">At this stage the company is just a bet.</span> <span class="s s313">I
didn't realize that when we were raising money.</span> <span class="s s314">Julian
thought we ought to value the company at several million 
dollars.</span> <span class="s s315">I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple
thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth
several million dollars.</span> <span class="s s316">Eventually we settled on one millon,
because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation
any lower.</span> <span class="s s317">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s318">What I didn't grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn't just 
the value of the code we'd written so far.</span> <span class="s s319">It was also the value
of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future
work we'd do, which turned out to be a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s320">The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with 
actual 
venture capital firms. 
But don't wait till you've burned 
through your last round of funding to start approaching them.</span> <span class="s s321">VCs are slow to
make up their minds.</span> <span class="s s322">They can take months.</span> <span class="s s323">You don't want to be 
running out of money while you're trying to negotiate with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s324">Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting
money from angels.</span> <span class="s s325">The amounts of money involved are larger, millions
usually.</span> <span class="s s326">So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose
more onerous conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s327">Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing.</span> 
<span class="s s328">Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced,
with a business background.</span> <span class="s s329">Maybe in some cases this is true.</span> <span class="s s330">And
yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business 
background, and he seems to have done ok.</span> <span class="s s331">Steve Jobs got booted
out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a
business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company.</span> <span class="s s332">So I
think people who are mature and experienced, with a business
background, may be overrated.</span> <span class="s s333">We used to call these guys "newscasters,"
because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and
generally didn't know much more than they read on the teleprompter.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s334">We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing
our startup entirely with angel money.</span> <span class="s s335">The main reason was that 
we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as
part of the deal.</span> <span class="s s336">That might have been ok if he was content to
limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to 
have a say in running the company?</span> <span class="s s337">That would have led to disaster,
because our software was so complex.</span> <span class="s s338">We were a company whose whole
m.</span><span class="s s339">o.</span> <span class="s s340">was to win through better technology.</span> <span class="s s341">The strategic decisions
were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn't need any help
with those.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s342">This was also one reason we didn't go public.</span> <span class="s s343">Back in 1998 our CFO
tried to talk me into it.</span> <span class="s s344">In those days you could go public as a
dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues,
we might have done well.</span> <span class="s s345">But I feared it would have meant taking
on a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, "can talk Wall Street's
language.</span><span class="s s346">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s347">I'm happy to see Google is bucking that trend.</span> <span class="s s348">They didn't talk
Wall Street's language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street
didn't buy.</span> <span class="s s349">And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself.</span>
<span class="s s350">They'll pay attention next time.</span> <span class="s s351">Wall Street learns new languages 
fast when money is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s352">You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize.</span> <span class="s s353">The 
reason is other VCs.</span> <span class="s s354">I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk
to them you realize that it's a seller's market.</span> <span class="s s355">Even now there
is too much money chasing too few good deals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s356">VCs form a pyramid.</span> <span class="s s357">At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and
Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you've never 
heard of.</span> <span class="s s358">What they all have in common is that a dollar from them 
is worth one dollar.</span> <span class="s s359">Most VCs will tell you that they don't just 
provide money, but connections and advice.</span> <span class="s s360">If you're talking to 
Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.</span> <span class="s s361">But such
advice and connections can come very expensive.</span> <span class="s s362">And as you go down
the food chain the VCs get rapidly 

dumber.</span> <span class="s s363">A few steps down from 
the top you're basically talking to bankers who've picked up a few
new vocabulary words from reading Wired.</span> <span class="s s364">(Does your product
use XML?</span><span class="s s365">) So I'd advise you to be skeptical about claims
of experience and connections.</span> <span class="s s366">Basically, a VC is a source of
money.</span> <span class="s s367">I'd be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money 
the soonest with the least strings attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s368">You may wonder how much to tell VCs.</span> <span class="s s369">And you should, because some
of them may one day be funding your competitors.</span> <span class="s s370">I think the best
plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything
either.</span> <span class="s s371">After all, as most VCs say, they're more interested in the
people than the ideas.</span> <span class="s s372">The main reason they want to talk about
your idea is to judge you, not the idea.</span> <span class="s s373">So as long as you seem
like you know what you're doing, you can probably keep a few things
back from them.</span> <span class="s s374">[7]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s375">Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don't want their money,
because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, 
and b) if you seem impressive, they'll be discouraged from investing
in your competitors.</span> <span class="s s376">The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially
if you only want them to know about you and don't want their money,
is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups 
to present to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s377">Not Spending It</span></p>
<p><span class="s s378">When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what
should you do with it?</span> <span class="s s379">Not spend it, that's what.</span> <span class="s s380">In nearly every 
startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money.</span> 
<span class="s s381">Usually there is something deeper wrong.</span> <span class="s s382">But even a proximate cause
of death is worth trying hard to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s383">During the Bubble many startups tried to "get big fast.</span><span class="s s384">"</span> <span class="s s385">Ideally
this meant getting a lot of customers fast.</span> <span class="s s386">But it was easy for
the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s387">Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast
is of course preferable.</span> <span class="s s388">But even that may be overrated.</span> <span class="s s389">The idea
is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for
competitors.</span> <span class="s s390">But I think in most businesses the advantages of being
first to market are not so overwhelmingly great.</span> <span class="s s391">Google is again
a case in point.</span> <span class="s s392">When they appeared it seemed as if search was a
mature market, dominated by big players who'd spent millions to
build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, 
Inktomi.</span> <span class="s s393">Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s394">But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing
in the search business.</span> <span class="s s395">You can come along at any point and make 
something better, and users will gradually seep over to you.</span> <span class="s s396">As 
if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising.</span> <span class="s s397">They're
like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use
it themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s398">The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those
millions improving their software.</span> <span class="s s399">Future startups should learn
from that mistake.</span> <span class="s s400">Unless you're in a market where products are 
as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent,
spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.</span> <span class="s s401">And few
if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated.</span> <span class="s s402">The dating sites 
are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the 
more evidence they're ripe for the picking.</span> <span class="s s403">(Fee, fie, fo, fum, I 
smell a company run by marketing guys.</span><span class="s s404">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s405">We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect
it was a good thing.</span> <span class="s s406">The founders all learned to do every job in 
the company.</span> <span class="s s407">As well as writing software, I had to do sales and
customer support.</span> <span class="s s408">At sales I was not very good.</span> <span class="s s409">I was persistent,
but I didn't have the smoothness of a good salesman.</span> <span class="s s410">My message 
to potential customers was: you'd be stupid not to sell online, and 
if you sell online you'd be stupid to use anyone else's software.</span> 
<span class="s s411">Both statements were true, but that's not the way to convince people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s412">I was great at customer support though.</span> <span class="s s413">Imagine talking to a
customer support person who not only knew everything about the
product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then
fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them.</span> <span class="s s414">Customers
loved us.</span> <span class="s s415">And we loved them, because when you're growing slow by
word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart
enough to find you by themselves.</span> <span class="s s416">There is nothing more valuable,
in the early stages of a startup, than smart users.</span> <span class="s s417">If you listen
to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.</span> 
<span class="s s418">And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay
you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s419">We officially launched in early 1996.</span> <span class="s s420">By the end of that year we
had about 70 users.</span> <span class="s s421">Since this was the era of "get big fast," I
worried about how small and obscure we were.</span> <span class="s s422">But in fact we were
doing exactly the right thing.</span> <span class="s s423">Once you get big (in users or
employees) it gets hard to change your product.</span> <span class="s s424">That year was
effectively a laboratory for improving our software.</span> <span class="s s425">By the end 
of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had 
a hope of catching up.</span> <span class="s s426">And since all the hackers had spent many
hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better
than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s427">That's the key to success as a startup.</span> <span class="s s428">There is nothing more 
important than understanding your business.</span> <span class="s s429">You might think that
anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it.</span> <span class="s s430">Far from it.</span> 
<span class="s s431">Google's secret
weapon was simply that they understood search.</span> <span class="s s432">I was working for 
Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn't understand search.</span> <span class="s s433">I
know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we
had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the
party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere "search engine.</span><span class="s s434">"</span>
<span class="s s435">Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than
one month's growth, and now that we were established as a "media 
company," or "portal," or whatever we were, search could safely be
allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s436">Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an 
important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions 
start with.</span> <span class="s s437">I think Yahoo gets that now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s438">Google understands a few other things most Web companies still
don't.</span> <span class="s s439">The most important is that you should put users before
advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren't.</span>
<span class="s s440">One of my favorite bumper stickers reads "if the people lead, the 
leaders will follow.</span><span class="s s441">"</span> <span class="s s442">Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes "get
all the users, and the advertisers will follow.</span><span class="s s443">"</span> <span class="s s444">More generally,
design your product to please users first, and then think about how
to make money from it.</span> <span class="s s445">If you don't put users first, you leave a 
gap for competitors who do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s446">To make something users love, you have to understand them.</span> <span class="s s447">And the
bigger you are, the harder that is.</span> <span class="s s448">So I say "get big slow.</span><span class="s s449">"</span> <span class="s s450">The
slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to
learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s451">The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture 
of cheapness.</span> <span class="s s452">That's something Yahoo did understand.</span> <span class="s s453">David Filo's 
title was "Chief Yahoo," but he was proud that his unofficial title
was "Cheap Yahoo.</span><span class="s s454">"</span> <span class="s s455">Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email
from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy, 
asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on
expensive RAID drives.</span> <span class="s s456">I was impressed by that.</span> <span class="s s457">Yahoo's market
cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying
about wasting a few gigs of disk space.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s458">When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to
feel rich.</span> <span class="s s459">It's important to realize you're not.</span> <span class="s s460">A rich company
is one with large revenues.</span> <span class="s s461">This money isn't revenue.</span> <span class="s s462">It's money
investors have given you in the hope you'll be able to generate 
revenues.</span> <span class="s s463">So despite those millions in the bank, you're still poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s464">For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm.</span>
<span class="s s465">Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive.</span> <span class="s s466">For us the
test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron
chairs.</span> <span class="s s467">The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular
with startups.</span> <span class="s s468">Especially the type, all too common then, that was
like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs.</span> <span class="s s469">We 
had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off.</span> <span class="s s470">This was 
slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty
atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right 
without knowing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s471">Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square.</span> <span class="s s472">It
had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a 
claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.</span> <span class="s s473">It must once have been inhabited
by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the 
walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against 
cosmic rays.</span> <span class="s s474">When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit
sheepish about the low production values.</span> <span class="s s475">But in fact that place
was the perfect space for a startup.</span> <span class="s s476">We felt like our role was to 
be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that 
is exactly the spirit you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s477">An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software.</span>
<span class="s s478">Cube farms suck for that, as you've probably discovered if you've
tried it.</span> <span class="s s479">Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than
at work?</span> <span class="s s480">So why not make work more like home?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s481">When you're looking for space for a startup, don't feel that it has
to look professional.</span> <span class="s s482">Professional means doing good work, not
elevators and glass walls.</span> <span class="s s483">I'd advise most startups to avoid
corporate space at first and just rent an apartment.</span> <span class="s s484">You want to
live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed
to be lived in as your office?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s485">Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be
in better locations than office buildings.</span> <span class="s s486">And for a startup
location is very important.</span> <span class="s s487">The key to productivity is for people
to come back to work after dinner.</span> <span class="s s488">Those hours after the phone
stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done.</span> <span class="s s489">Great
things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, 
talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement 
them.</span> <span class="s s490">So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of
restaurants around, not some dreary office park that's a wasteland
after 6:00 PM.</span> <span class="s s491">Once a company shifts over into the model where 
everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you've
lost something extraordinarily valuable.</span> <span class="s s492">God help you if you
actually start in that mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s493">If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three 
places I'd consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard,
or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University
or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of 
campus.</span> <span class="s s494">These are the only places I know that have the right kind
of vibe.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s495">The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people.</span> 
<span class="s s496">I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing
a company can do.</span> <span class="s s497">To start with, people are a recurring expense, 
which is the worst kind.</span> <span class="s s498">They also tend to cause you to grow out 
of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office
building that will make your software worse.</span> <span class="s s499">But worst of all,
they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone's 
office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to
have a meeting about it.</span> <span class="s s500">So the fewer people you can hire, the
better.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s501">During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.</span> <span class="s s502">They
wanted to get "staffed up" as soon as possible, as if you couldn't 
get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding 
job title.</span> <span class="s s503">That's big company thinking.</span> <span class="s s504">Don't hire people to fill
the gaps in some a priori org chart.</span> <span class="s s505">The only reason to hire someone
is to do something you'd like to do but can't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s506">If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why
do nearly all companies do it?</span> <span class="s s507">I think the main reason is that
people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them.</span>
<span class="s s508">This weakness often extends right up to the CEO.</span> <span class="s s509">If you ever end
up running a company, you'll find the most common question people
ask is how many employees you have.</span> <span class="s s510">This is their way of weighing
you.</span> <span class="s s511">It's not just random people who ask this; even reporters do.</span>
<span class="s s512">And they're going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a
thousand than if it's ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s513">This is ridiculous, really.</span> <span class="s s514">If two companies have the same revenues,
it's the one with fewer employees that's more impressive.</span> <span class="s s515">When 
people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered
"twenty," I could see them thinking that we didn't count for much.</span>
<span class="s s516">I used to want to add "but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly
kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger
of the two numbers?</span><span class="s s517">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s518">As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice 
between seeming impressive, and being impressive.</span> <span class="s s519">Any of you who 
were nerds in high school know about this 
choice.</span> <span class="s s520">Keep doing it when you start a company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s521">Should You?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s522">But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person
to do it? If you are, is it worth it?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s523">More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than
realize it.</span> <span class="s s524">That's the main reason I wrote this.</span> <span class="s s525">There could be 
ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be
a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s526">I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a 
startup.</span> <span class="s s527">But the idea terrified me at first.</span> <span class="s s528">I was forced into 
it because I was a Lisp hacker.</span> <span class="s s529">The company
I'd been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there 
were not a lot of other companies using Lisp.</span> <span class="s s530">Since I couldn't 
bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995,
remember, when "another language" meant C++) the only option seemed
to be to start a new company using Lisp.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s531">I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you're a Lisp hacker
you'll know what I mean.</span> <span class="s s532">And if the idea of starting a startup
frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there 
must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too 
intimidated to try.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s533">So who should start a startup?</span> <span class="s s534">Someone who is a good hacker, between
about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one
shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working
life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s535">I can't say precisely what a good hacker is.</span> <span class="s s536">At a first rate 
university this might include the top half of computer science 
majors.</span> <span class="s s537">Though of course you don't have to be a CS major to be a
hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s538">It's hard to tell whether you're a good hacker, especially when
you're young.</span> <span class="s s539">Fortunately the process of starting startups tends
to select them automatically.</span> <span class="s s540">What drives people to start startups
is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don't 
these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?</span> <span class="s s541">And that's 
also a sign that one is a good hacker.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s542">I put the lower bound at 23 not because there's something that
doesn't happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see
what it's like in an existing business before you try running your
own.</span> <span class="s s543">The business doesn't have to be a startup.</span> <span class="s s544">I spent a year
working for a software company to pay off my college loans.</span> <span class="s s545">It was
the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing 
it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business.</span>
<span class="s s546">In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don't have a lot
of meetings; don't have chunks of code that multiple people own;
don't have a sales guy running the company; don't make a high-end
product; don't let your code get too big; don't leave finding bugs
to QA people; don't go too long between releases; don't isolate
developers from users; don't move from Cambridge to Route 128; and
so on.</span> <span class="s s547">[8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive 
ones.</span> <span class="s s548">Perhaps even more valuable: it's hard to repeat a brilliant
performance, but it's straightforward to avoid errors.</span> <span class="s s549">[9]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s550">The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that 
people won't take you seriously.</span> <span class="s s551">VCs won't trust you, and will try
to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding.</span> <span class="s s552">Customers
will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded.</span> <span class="s s553">Even
you yourself, unless you're very unusual, will feel your age to 
some degree; you'll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much 
older than you, and if you're 21, hiring only people younger rather 
limits your options.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s554">Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to.</span>
<span class="s s555">Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft.</span> <span class="s s556">(Paul 
Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.</span><span class="s s557">) So if
you're thinking, I don't care what he says, I'm going to start a
company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with
it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s558">The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it.</span> <span class="s s559">One reason I put 
it there is that I don't think many people have the physical stamina
much past that age.</span> <span class="s s560">I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every
night, seven days a week.</span> <span class="s s561">I don't know if I could do that now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s562">Also,
startups are a big risk financially.</span> <span class="s s563">If you try something that
blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year
olds are broke.</span> <span class="s s564">By 38 you can't take so many risks-- especially
if you have kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s565">My final test may be the most restrictive.</span> <span class="s s566">Do you actually want
to start a startup?</span> <span class="s s567">What it amounts to, economically, is compressing
your working life into the smallest possible space.</span> <span class="s s568">Instead of
working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for 
four.</span> <span class="s s569">And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case it
probably won't take four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s570">During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not
working, your competitors will be.</span> <span class="s s571">My only leisure activities were
running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about
fifteen minutes of reading a night.</span> <span class="s s572">I had a girlfriend for a total
of two months during that three year period.</span> <span class="s s573">Every couple weeks I
would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a 
friend's house for dinner.</span> <span class="s s574">I went to visit my family twice.</span>
<span class="s s575">Otherwise I just worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s576">Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some
of my best friends.</span> <span class="s s577">Sometimes it was even technically interesting.</span>
<span class="s s578">But only about 10% of the time.</span> <span class="s s579">The best I can say for the other
90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then.</span>
<span class="s s580">Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours,
and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered
generator inside our offices.</span> <span class="s s581">I won't try that again.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s582">I don't think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a
startup is more than you'd endure in an ordinary working life.</span> <span class="s s583">It's
probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it's 
compressed into a short period.</span> <span class="s s584">So mainly what a startup buys you 
is time.</span> <span class="s s585">That's the way to think about it if you're trying to 
decide whether to start one.</span> <span class="s s586">If you're the sort of person who would
like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working 
for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s587">For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate
school.</span> <span class="s s588">Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people,
to start software startups.</span> <span class="s s589">You may worry that if you do you'll 
blow your chances of an academic career.</span> <span class="s s590">But it's possible to be 
part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first.</span> 
<span class="s s591">Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole 
time, and both got their degrees.</span> 
<span class="s s592">There are few sources of energy
so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s593">If you do have to
leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long.</span> <span class="s s594">If
a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can 
return to academic life.</span> <span class="s s595">And if it succeeds, you may find you no 
longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s596">If you want to do it, do it.</span> <span class="s s597">Starting a startup is not the great
mystery it seems from outside.</span> <span class="s s598">It's not something you have to know
about "business" to do.</span> <span class="s s599">Build something users love, and spend less
than you make.</span> <span class="s s600">How hard is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s601">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s602">[1] Google's revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes
from ads on other sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s603">[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that
there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses.</span> <span class="s s604">For 
example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman
who had small children, or was likely to have them soon.</span> <span class="s s605">But you're
not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids 
soon.</span> <span class="s s606">Believe it or not, under current US law, you're not even 
allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence.</span> <span class="s s607">Whereas when
you're starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you
want about who you start it with.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s608">[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because
you can do it mostly on your own.</span> <span class="s s609"></span></p>
<p><span class="s s610">[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest
company of all, the government.</span> <span class="s s611">Yes, there are lots of opportunities
to sell them technology.</span> <span class="s s612">But let someone else start those startups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s613">[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care 
about the paperwork there, and that there's more of it.</span> <span class="s s614">Which helps
explain why there are not more startups in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s615">[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because
Julian got 10% of the company.</span> <span class="s s616">But this is a very misleading number,
because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s617">[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you.</span>
<span class="s s618">There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick
your brains.</span> <span class="s s619">But you can never tell for sure which these are, so
the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention
a few critical technical secrets.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s620">[8] I was as bad an employee as this place was a company. I
apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s621">[9] You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business
by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.</span></p>
