  <h2><span class="s s1">What I Did this Summer</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">October 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.</span> <span class="s s4">We were
surprised how well it went.</span> <span class="s s5">Overall only about 10% of startups 
succeed, but if I had to guess now, I'd predict three or four of 
the eight startups we funded will make it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have
either closed a round or are likely to soon.</span> <span class="s s7">Two have already
turned down (lowball) acquisition offers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising
by the end of the summer.</span> <span class="s s9">What's going on?</span> <span class="s s10">Did some kind of anomaly
make this summer's applicants especially good?</span> <span class="s s11">We worry about that,
but we can't think of one.</span> <span class="s s12">We'll find out this winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">The whole summer was full of surprises.</span> <span class="s s14">The best was that the hypothesis we were testing seems to be
correct.</span> <span class="s s15">Young hackers can start viable companies.</span> <span class="s s16">This is good
news for two reasons: (a) it's an encouraging thought, and (b) it 
means that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is not
hosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">Age</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">More precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends
mainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how old
you are or how much business experience you have.</span> <span class="s s19">The results so
far bear this out.</span> <span class="s s20">The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18 
to 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their ages
and how well they're doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">This should not really be surprising.</span> <span class="s s22">Bill Gates and Michael Dell 
were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous.</span>
<span class="s s23">Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soon
as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less
money than most people think.</span> <span class="s s25">Other investors were surprised to
hear the most we gave any group was $20,000.</span> <span class="s s26">But we knew it was
possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on
$10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">And so it proved this summer.</span> <span class="s s28">Three months' funding is enough to
get into second gear.</span> <span class="s s29">We had a demo day for potential investors
ten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready
by that time.</span> <span class="s s30">One, Reddit, had
already launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they 
had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard.</span> <span class="s s32">People
this age are commonly seen as lazy.</span> <span class="s s33">I think in some cases it's not
so much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the work
they're offered is unappetizing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people
do real work, they work hard, whatever their age.</span> <span class="s s35">As one of the
founders said "I'd read that starting a startup consumed your life, 
but I had no idea what that meant until I did it.</span><span class="s s36">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">I'd feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard.</span> <span class="s s38">But
we're not these people's bosses.</span> <span class="s s39">They're working on their own
projects.</span> <span class="s s40">And what makes them work is not us but their competitors.</span>
<span class="s s41">Like good athletes, they don't work hard because the coach yells
at them, but because they want to win.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder 
than employees.</span> <span class="s s43">It seems like a win for everyone.</span> <span class="s s44">The only catch
is that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while an
employer gets nearly all of it.</span> <span class="s s45">(We're counting on it being 5-7%
of a much larger number.</span><span class="s s46">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily
responsible.</span> <span class="s s48">I can't think of a time when one failed to do something
they'd promised to, even by being late for an appointment.</span> <span class="s s49">This
is another lesson the world has yet to learn.</span> <span class="s s50">One of the founders
discovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with
executives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company
to rent him a car, because he was too young.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent
laziness of people this age.</span> <span class="s s52">They seem lazy because the work they're
given is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they're not
given any power.</span> <span class="s s53">Some of them, anyway.</span> <span class="s s54">We only have a sample size
of about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in their
early twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">Morale</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic.</span> <span class="s s57">They also 
wanted very much to get rich.</span> <span class="s s58">These qualities might seem incompatible,
but they're not.</span> <span class="s s59">These guys want to get rich, but they want to do
it by changing the world.</span> <span class="s s60">They wouldn't (well, seven of the eight
groups wouldn't) be interested in making money by speculating in
stocks.</span> <span class="s s61">They want to make something people use.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">I think this makes them more effective as founders.</span> <span class="s s63">As hard as 
people will work for money, they'll work harder for a cause.</span> <span class="s s64">And 
since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the
paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money
are those who aren't in it just for the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">The founders of Kiko, for example, 
are working on an Ajax calendar.</span> <span class="s s66">They want to get rich, but they
pay more attention to design than they would if that were their
only motivation.</span> <span class="s s67">You can tell just by looking at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">I never considered it till this summer, but this might be another
reason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by
MBAs.</span> <span class="s s69">Perhaps it's not just that hackers understand technology
better, but that they're driven by more powerful motivations.</span>
<span class="s s70">Microsoft, as I've said before, is a dangerously misleading example.</span> 
<span class="s s71">Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies.</span> 
<span class="s s72">Google is a better model.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s73">Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean,
we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors.</span>
<span class="s s74">But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we
started Viaweb.</span> <span class="s s75">For the first year, our initial reaction to news 
of a competitor was always: we're doomed.</span> <span class="s s76">Just as a hypochondriac
magnifies his symptoms till he's convinced he has some terrible
disease, when you're not used to competitors you magnify them into
monsters.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">Here's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous
as they seem.</span> <span class="s s78">Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them.</span>
<span class="s s79">And it certainly doesn't matter how many of them there are, any
more than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners
are behind him.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">"It's a crowded market," I remember one founder saying worriedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">"Are you the current leader?" I asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">"Yes."</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">"Is anyone able to develop software faster than you?"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">"Probably not."</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">"Well, if you're ahead now, and you're the fastest, then you'll
stay ahead. What difference does it make how many others there
are?"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewrite
their software from scratch.</span> <span class="s s87">I told them it would be a bad sign
if they didn't.</span> <span class="s s88">The main function of your initial version is to 
be rewritten.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">That's why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability,
internationalization, and heavy-duty security at first.</span> <span class="s s90">[1] I can
imagine an advocate of "best practices" saying these ought to be
considered from the start.</span> <span class="s s91">And he'd be right, except that they
interfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to 
be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.</span> <span class="s s92">Having to
retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly.</span> 
<span class="s s93">The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version
was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies.</span>
<span class="s s95">Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light
enough to evolve.</span> <span class="s s96">In big companies, all the pressure is in the 
direction of over-engineering.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">What Got Learned</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups 
would need help.</span> <span class="s s99">That turned out to vary a lot.</span> <span class="s s100">Some we helped
with technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an application
to run on multiple servers.</span> <span class="s s101">Most we helped with strategy questions,
like what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away.</span>
<span class="s s102">Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how 
much money should they take and what kind of terms should they
expect?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">However, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like
patents and investors.</span> <span class="s s104">These problems aren't intrinsically difficult,
just unfamiliar.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s105">It was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast they
learned.</span> <span class="s s106">The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a 
practice session where all the groups gave their presentations.</span> 
<span class="s s107">They were all terrible.</span> <span class="s s108">We tried to explain how to make them better,
but we didn't have much hope.</span> <span class="s s109">So on demo day I told the assembled
angels and VCs that these guys were hackers, not MBAs, and so while
their software was good, we should not expect slick presentations 
from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations.</span> 
<span class="s s111">Gone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features.</span> <span class="s s112">It was
as if they'd spent the past week at acting school.</span> <span class="s s113">I still don't 
know how they did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">Perhaps watching each others' presentations helped them see what
they'd been doing wrong.</span> <span class="s s115">Just as happens in college, the summer 
founders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more than they
learned from us.</span> <span class="s s116">A lot of the problems they face are the same, 
from dealing with investors to hacking Javascript.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">I don't want to give the impression there were no problems this 
summer.</span> <span class="s s118">A lot went wrong, as usually happens with startups.</span> <span class="s s119">One
group got an "exploding
term-sheet" from some VCs.</span> <span class="s s120">Pretty much all the groups who had
dealings with big companies found that big companies do everything
infinitely slowly.</span> <span class="s s121">(This is to be expected.</span> <span class="s s122">If big companies
weren't incapable, there would be no room for startups to exist.</span><span class="s s123">)
And of course there were the usual nightmares associated with
servers.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s125">In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood
diseases.</span> <span class="s s126">Some of this summer's eight startups will 
probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight 
succeeded.</span> <span class="s s127">But what kills them will not be dramatic, external 
threats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">So far, though, the news is all good.</span> <span class="s s129">In fact, we were surprised
how much fun the summer was for us.</span> <span class="s s130">The main reason was how much
we liked the founders.</span> <span class="s s131">They're so earnest and hard-working.</span> <span class="s s132">They
seem to like us too.</span> <span class="s s133">And this illustrates another advantage of
investing over hiring: our relationship with them is way better 
than it would be between a boss and an employee.</span> <span class="s s134">Y Combinator ends
up being more like an older brother than a parent.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s135">I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions.</span>
<span class="s s136">Fortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to
someone, I could usually get to the right person by at most one
hop.</span> <span class="s s137">I remember wondering, how did my friends get to be so eminent?</span>
<span class="s s138">and a second later realizing: shit, I'm forty.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">Another surprise was that the three-month batch format,
which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turned
out to be an advantage.</span> <span class="s s140">When we started Y Combinator, we planned
to invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in, 
we'd evaluate them and decide yes or no.</span> <span class="s s141">The SFP
was just an experiment to get things started.</span> <span class="s s142">But it worked so
well that we plan to do 
all 
our investing this way, one cycle in
the summer and one in winter.</span> <span class="s s143">It's more efficient for us, and
better for the startups too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common
problem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no social
life.</span> <span class="s s145">(I remember that part all too well.</span><span class="s s146">) This way, they were
guaranteed a social event at least once a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s147">Independence</span></p>
<p><span class="s s148">I've heard Y Combinator described as an "incubator.</span><span class="s s149">"</span> <span class="s s150">Actually we're
the opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and
we make a point of exerting less.</span> <span class="s s151">Among other things, incubators
usually make you work in their office-- that's where the 
word "incubator" comes from.</span> <span class="s s152">That seems the wrong model.</span> <span class="s s153">If
investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful 
forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s154">Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble.</span> <span class="s s155">There's 
still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because
they're a bad idea.</span> <span class="s s156">My vote is they're a bad idea.</span> <span class="s s157">I think they 
fail because they select for the wrong people.</span> <span class="s s158">When we were starting
a startup, we would never have taken funding from an "incubator.</span><span class="s s159">"</span>
<span class="s s160">We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.</span> <span class="s s161">And 
people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s162">Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit
of independence.</span> <span class="s s163">I've been wondering about that.</span> <span class="s s164">Are some people
just a lot more independent than others, or would everyone be this
way if they were allowed to?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s165">As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: some
of each.</span> <span class="s s166">But my main conclusion from the summer is that there's
more environment in the mix than most people realize.</span> <span class="s s167">I could see
that from how the founders' attitudes changed during the 
summer.</span> <span class="s s168">Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told
what to do.</span> <span class="s s169">They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom.</span>
<span class="s s170">But they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seem
about four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at the
beginning of the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s171">When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most about
starting a company, one said "the most shocking thing is that it 
worked."</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">It will take more experience to know for sure, but my guess is that
a lot of hackers could do this-- that if you put people in a position
of independence, they develop the qualities they need.</span> <span class="s s173">Throw them
off a cliff, and most will find on the way down that they have 
wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work in
the other direction too.</span> <span class="s s175">Most hackers are 
employees, and this molds
you into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible as
surely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handle
it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s176">If I'm right, "hacker" will mean something different in twenty years
than it does now.</span> <span class="s s177">Increasingly it will mean the people who run the
company.</span> <span class="s s178">Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would
have happened anyway.</span> <span class="s s179">Power is shifting from the people who deal
with money to the people who create technology, and if our experience
this summer is any guide, this will be a good thing.</span></p>
