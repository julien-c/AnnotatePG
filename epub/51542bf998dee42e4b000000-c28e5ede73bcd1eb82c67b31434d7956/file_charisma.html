<p><span class="s s2">
November 2004, corrected June 2006</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Occam's razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations.</span>
<span class="s s4">I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I'm about
to propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives.</span>
<span class="s s5">But Occam's razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree
with it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Theory: In US presidential elections, the more 
charismatic candidate wins.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right,
have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously.</span> <span class="s s8">When one
candidate beats another they look for political explanations.</span> <span class="s s9">The
country is shifting to the left, or the right.</span> <span class="s s10">And that sort of
shift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which
makes it easy to believe it was the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George
Bush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left.</span> <span class="s s12">Clinton just
seemed more dynamic.</span> <span class="s s13">He seemed to want the job more.</span> <span class="s s14">Bush seemed
old and tired.</span> <span class="s s15">I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">Clinton didn't represent any national shift leftward.</span>
<span class="s s17">[1]
He was
just more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole.</span>
<span class="s s18">In 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it:
Gore had Clinton's policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered
proportionally.</span> 
<span class="s s19">[2]
Same story in 2004.</span> <span class="s s20">Kerry was smarter and more
articulate than Bush, but rather a stiff.</span> <span class="s s21">And Kerry lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern.</span> 
<span class="s s23">Pundits said Carter beat Ford
because the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate.</span>
<span class="s s24">And yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grin
and folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz.</span> <span class="s s25">Four years
later, pundits said the country had lurched to the right.</span> <span class="s s26">But
Reagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismatic
than Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressful
years in office).</span> <span class="s s27">In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and
Mondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results.</span>
<span class="s s28">The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would later
be vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because
in 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic
Michael Dukakis.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the
same pattern played out in 1964 and 1972.</span> <span class="s s30">The most recent
counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert
Humphrey.</span> <span class="s s31">But when you examine that election, it tends to support
the charisma theory more than contradict it.</span> <span class="s s32">As Joe McGinnis
recounts in his famous book The Selling of the President 1968,
Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply
refused to debate him on TV.</span> <span class="s s33">He knew he couldn't afford to let the
two of them be seen side by side.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">Now a candidate probably couldn't get away with refusing to debate.</span>
<span class="s s35">But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving.</span> <span class="s s36">In
effect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see
the real Nixon.</span> <span class="s s37">All they saw were carefully scripted campaign
spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s38">Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960.</span>
<span class="s s39">Though this election is usually given as an example of the power
of TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by party
machines in Illinois and Texas.</span> <span class="s s40">But TV was still young in 1960;
only 87% of households had it.</span>
<span class="s s41">[3]
Undoubtedly TV helped Kennedy,
so historians are correct in regarding this election as a
watershed.</span> <span class="s s42">TV required a new kind of candidate.</span> <span class="s s43">There would be no
more Calvin Coolidges.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to lose
presidential elections.</span> <span class="s s45">The core of the Democrats' ideology seems
to be a belief in government.</span> <span class="s s46">Perhaps this tends to attract people
who are earnest, but dull.</span> <span class="s s47">Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar
in that respect that they might have been brothers.</span> <span class="s s48">Good thing for
the Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton,
even if some scandal results.</span> 
<span class="s s49">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if
only fake ones like Willie Horton.</span> <span class="s s51">And yet, if they are, we have
a remarkable coincidence to explain.</span> <span class="s s52">In every presidential election
since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate
has won.</span> <span class="s s53">Surprising, isn't it, that voters' opinions on the issues
have lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left or
right in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reporters
stuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuations
of the stock market.</span> <span class="s s55">Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter
looks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the market
was up on news of Intel's earnings, or down on fears of instability
in the Middle East.</span> <span class="s s56">Suppose we could somehow feed these reporters
false information about market closes, but give them all the other
news intact.</span> <span class="s s57">Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly,
and not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good
(or bad) news there was that day?</span> <span class="s s58">That they would say, hey, wait
a minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the Middle
East?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">I'm not saying that issues don't matter to voters.</span> <span class="s s60">Of course they
do.</span> <span class="s s61">But the major parties know so well which issues matter how
much to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in
response, that they tend to split the difference on the issues,
leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can't
control: charisma.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as
Clinton in the 2004 election, he'd have won.</span> <span class="s s63">And we'd be reading
that the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of
that the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians in
middle America.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">During the 1992 election, the Clinton campaign staff had a big sign
in their office saying "It's the economy, stupid.</span><span class="s s65">"</span> <span class="s s66">Perhaps it was
even simpler than they thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">Postscript</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">Opinions seem to be divided about the charisma theory.</span> <span class="s s69">Some say
it's impossible, others say it's obvious.</span> <span class="s s70">This seems a good sign.</span>
<span class="s s71">Perhaps it's in the sweet spot midway between.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">As for it being impossible, I reply: here's the data; here's the
theory; theory explains data 100%.</span> <span class="s s73">To a scientist, at least, that
means it deserves attention, however implausible it seems.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">You can't believe voters are so superficial that they just choose
the most charismatic guy?</span> <span class="s s75">My theory doesn't require that.</span> <span class="s s76">I'm not
proposing that charisma is the only factor, just that it's the only
one left after the efforts of the two parties cancel one
another out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">As for the theory being obvious, as far as I know, no one has
proposed it before.</span> <span class="s s78">Election forecasters are proud when they can
achieve the same results with much more complicated models.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">Finally, to the people who say that the theory is probably true,
but rather depressing: it's not so bad as it seems. The phenomenon
is like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it's there, it will
disappear.</span> <span class="s s80">Once both parties realize it's a waste of time to
nominate uncharismatic candidates, they'll tend to nominate only
the most charismatic ones.</span> <span class="s s81">And if the candidates are equally
charismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decided
on issues, as political commentators like to think they are now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">[1]
As Clinton himself discovered to his surprise when, in one of
his first acts as president, he tried to shift the military leftward.</span>
<span class="s s84">After a bruising fight he escaped with a face-saving compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">[2]
True, Gore won the popular vote.</span> <span class="s s86">But politicians know the electoral
vote decides the election, so that's what they campaign for.</span> <span class="s s87">If Bush
had been campaigning for the popular vote he would presumably have
got more of it.</span> <span class="s s88">(Thanks to judgmentalist for this point.</span><span class="s s89">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">[3]
Source: Nielsen Media Research.</span> <span class="s s91">Of the remaining 13%, 11 didn't
have TV because they couldn't afford it.</span> <span class="s s92">I'd argue that the missing
11% were probably also the 11% most susceptible to charisma.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">[4]
One implication of this theory is that parties shouldn't be too
quick to reject candidates with skeletons in their closets.</span>
<span class="s s94">Charismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky
clean dullards, but in practice that doesn't seem to lose elections.</span>
<span class="s s95">The current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his
twenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected
with a base of evangelical Christians.</span> <span class="s s96">All you have to do is say
you've reformed, and stonewall about the details.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Maria Daniels, Jessica Livingston,
Jackie McDonough, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this, and
to Eric Raymond for pointing out that I was wrong about 1968.</span></p>
