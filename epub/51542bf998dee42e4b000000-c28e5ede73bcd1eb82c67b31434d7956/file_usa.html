<p><span class="s s3">(This is a new essay for the Japanese edition of 
Hackers 
&amp; Painters.</span>
<span class="s s4">It tries to explain why Americans make some things well 
and others badly.</span><span class="s s5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">A few years ago an Italian friend of mine travelled by train from
Boston to Providence.</span> <span class="s s7">She had only been in America for a
couple weeks and hadn't seen much of the country yet.</span> <span class="s s8">She arrived
looking astonished.</span> <span class="s s9">"It's so ugly!</span><span class="s s10">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine
the squalor of the man-made bits of America.</span> <span class="s s12">In travel books
they show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon,
whitewater rafting, horses in a field.</span> <span class="s s13">If you see
pictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a
view of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance,
or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">How can it be, visitors must wonder. How can the richest country
in the world look like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence.</span> <span class="s s16">Americans are good
at some things and bad at others.</span> <span class="s s17">We're good at making
movies and software, and bad at making cars and cities.</span>
<span class="s s18">And I think we may be good at what we're good at for the same
reason we're bad at what we're bad at.</span> <span class="s s19">We're impatient.</span>
<span class="s s20">In America, if you want to do something, you don't worry that
it might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, or
that people might think you're getting above yourself.</span> <span class="s s21">If you
want to do something, as Nike says, just do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">This works well in some fields and badly in others.</span> <span class="s s23">I suspect
it works in movies and software because they're both messy 
processes.</span> <span class="s s24">"Systematic"
is the last word I'd use to describe the way 
good programmers write software.</span>
<span class="s s25">Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after
careful planning, like the pyramids.</span> <span class="s s26">It's something they
plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds,
like a charcoal sketch.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">In software, paradoxical
as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast.</span>
<span class="s s28">If you work slowly and meticulously,
you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial,
mistaken idea.</span>
<span class="s s29">Working slowly and meticulously is
premature optimization.</span> <span class="s s30">Better to get a
prototype done fast, and see what new ideas
it gives you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software.</span>
<span class="s s32">Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections
and usually quite different from what was originally envisioned.</span> 
<span class="s s33">But interesting, and finished fairly quickly.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s35">I think we get away with this in movies and software
because they're both malleable mediums. Boldness pays.</span>

<span class="s s36">And if at the last minute two parts don't quite 
fit, you can figure out some hack that will at least conceal
the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Not so with cars, or cities.</span> <span class="s s38">They are all too physical.</span>
<span class="s s39">If the car business worked like software or movies, you'd
surpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only
fifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when 
you wanted to park it.</span> <span class="s s40">But with physical products there are
more constraints.</span> <span class="s s41">You don't win by dramatic innovations
so much as by good taste and attention to detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">The trouble is, the very word "taste"
sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears.</span>
<span class="s s43">It seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate.</span>
<span class="s s44">Blue staters think it's "subjective," and red staters 
think it's for sissies.</span> <span class="s s45">So anyone in America
who really cares about design will be sailing upwind.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s46">Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with
the US car industry was the workers.</span>
<span class="s s47">We don't hear that any more now that Japanese companies
are building cars in the US.</span> <span class="s s48">The problem with
American cars is bad design.</span> <span class="s s49">You can see that just by
looking at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">All that extra sheet metal on the AMC Matador wasn't
added by the workers.</span> <span class="s s51">The problem
with this car, as with American cars today, is that it was
designed by marketing people instead of designers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Why do the Japanese make better cars than us?</span> <span class="s s53">Some say it's
because their culture encourages cooperation.</span> <span class="s s54">That may come
into it.</span> <span class="s s55">But in this case it seems more to the point that
their culture prizes design and craftsmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we
have in the West.</span> <span class="s s57">When you look at swords they
made in 1200, you just can't believe the date on the label
is right.</span>
<span class="s s58">Presumably their cars fit together more 
precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has.</span>
<span class="s s59">They're obsessed with making things well.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">Not us.</span>
<span class="s s61">When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the 
job done.</span> <span class="s s62">Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes.</span>
<span class="s s63">We can stop there, and have something crude but
serviceable, like a Vise-grip.</span> <span class="s s64">Or we can improve it,
which usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament.</span>
<span class="s s65">When we want to make a car "better,"
we stick tail fins on it, or make it 
longer, or make the 
windows smaller, depending on the current fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">Ditto for houses.</span> <span class="s s67">In America you can have either a flimsy box banged
together out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion-- a
flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall,
but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings.</span>
<span class="s s68">Rich people don't get better design or craftsmanship;
they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the
standard house.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">We don't especially prize design or craftsmanship here.</span> <span class="s s70">What
we like is speed, and we're willing to do something in an ugly
way to get it done fast.</span> <span class="s s71">In some
fields, like software or movies, this is a net win.</span> 
</p>
<p><span class="s s73">But it's not just that software and movies are malleable mediums.
In those businesses, the designers (though they're
not generally called that) have more power.</span> 
<span class="s s74">Software companies, at least successful ones, tend to be run
by programmers.</span> <span class="s s75">And in the film industry, though producers
may second-guess directors, the director controls most of
what appears on the screen.</span>
<span class="s s76">And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all
have this in common: the people in charge care about
design-- the former because the designers are in charge, and the latter
because the whole culture cares about design.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">I think most Japanese executives would be horrified at
the idea of making a bad car.</span> <span class="s s78">Whereas American executives,
in their hearts, still believe the most important thing about
a car is the image it projects.</span>
<span class="s s79">Make a good car?</span> <span class="s s80">What's "good?</span><span class="s s81">"</span> <span class="s s82">It's so subjective.</span>
<span class="s s83">If you want to know how to design a car, ask a focus group.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">Instead of relying on their own internal design compass
(like Henry Ford did),
American car companies try to make what marketing people
think consumers want.</span> <span class="s s85">But it isn't working.</span> <span class="s s86">American cars continue
to lose market share.</span> <span class="s s87">And the reason is that the customer
doesn't want what he thinks he wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">Letting focus groups design your cars for you 
only wins in the short term.</span> <span class="s s89">In the long term, it pays
to bet on good design.</span> <span class="s s90">The focus group may say they want the
meretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more is
to imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a
small minority, really do care about good design.</span>
<span class="s s91">Eventually the
pimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyers
have switched from Cadillac to Lexus, and do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">Apple is an interesting counterexample to the general
American trend.</span> <span class="s s93">If you want to buy a nice CD player, you'll
probably buy a Japanese one.</span> <span class="s s94">But if you want to buy an
MP3 player, you'll probably buy an iPod.</span> <span class="s s95">What happened?</span>
<span class="s s96">Why doesn't Sony dominate MP3 players?</span> <span class="s s97">Because Apple is
in the consumer electronics business now, and unlike
other American companies, they're obsessed with good design.</span> 
<span class="s s98">Or more precisely, their CEO is.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">I just got an iPod, and it's not just nice.</span> <span class="s s100">It's 
surprisingly nice.</span> <span class="s s101">For it to surprise me, it must be
satisfying expectations I didn't know I had.</span> <span class="s s102">No focus
group is going to discover those.</span> <span class="s s103">Only a great 
designer can.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s104">Cars aren't the worst thing we make in America.</span>
<span class="s s105">Where the just-do-it model fails most dramatically is in our cities-- or
rather, exurbs.</span>
<span class="s s106">If real estate developers operated on a large enough scale, if
they built whole towns, market forces would compel
them to build towns that didn't suck.</span> <span class="s s107">But they only build a
couple office buildings or suburban streets at a time, and the
result is so depressing that the inhabitants consider it a great
treat to fly to Europe and spend a couple weeks living what
is, for people there, just everyday life.</span> <span class="s s108">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">But the just-do-it model does have advantages.</span> <span class="s s110">It seems the clear
winner for generating wealth and technical innovations
(which are practically the same thing).</span> <span class="s s111">I think speed is the reason.</span>
<span class="s s112">It's hard to create wealth by making a commodity.</span> <span class="s s113">The
real value is in things that are new, and if you want to
be the first to make something, it helps to work fast.</span>
<span class="s s114">For better or worse, the just-do-it model is fast,
whether you're Dan Bricklin writing the prototype of VisiCalc in
a weekend, or a real estate developer
building a block of shoddy condos in a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s115">If I had to choose between the just-do-it model and the
careful model, I'd probably choose just-do-it.</span>
<span class="s s116">But do we have to choose?</span> <span class="s s117">Could we have it both ways?</span>
<span class="s s118">Could Americans have nice
places to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit
that makes us good at software?</span> <span class="s s119">Could other countries
introduce more individualism into their technology companies
and research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls?</span>
<span class="s s120">I'm optimistic.</span> <span class="s s121">It's harder to
say about other countries, but in the US, at least, I think 
we can have both.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">Apple is an encouraging example.</span> <span class="s s123">They've managed to preserve
enough of the impatient, hackerly spirit you need to write
software.</span> <span class="s s124">And yet when
you pick up a new Apple laptop, well, it doesn't
seem American.</span> <span class="s s125">It's too perfect.</span> <span class="s s126">It seems as if it
must have been made by a Swedish or a Japanese company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s127">In many technologies, version 2 has higher resolution.</span> <span class="s s128">Why
not in design generally?</span> <span class="s s129">I think we'll gradually see
national characters superseded
by occupational characters: hackers in Japan will be allowed
to behave with a willfulness 
that would now seem unJapanese,
and products in America will be designed with an
insistence on taste that would now seem unAmerican.</span>
<span class="s s130">Perhaps the most successful countries, in the future, will be
those most willing to ignore what are now considered
national characters, and do each kind of work in the way
that works best.</span> <span class="s s131">Race you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s133">[1] Japanese cities are ugly too, but for different reasons.</span>
<span class="s s134">Japan is prone to earthquakes, so buildings are traditionally
seen as temporary; there is no grand tradition of city planning
like the one Europeans inherited from Rome.</span> <span class="s s135">The other cause is
the notoriously corrupt relationship between the government
and construction companies.</span></p>
