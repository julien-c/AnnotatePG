  <h2><span class="s s1">A Fundraising Survival Guide</span></h2>
<div><div>
<span class="s s2">August 2008Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup.</span>
<span class="s s3">The hardest part is making something people want: most startups
that die, die because they didn't do that.</span> <span class="s s4">But the second biggest
cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.</span>
<span class="s s5">Fundraising is brutal.</span><span class="s s6">One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.</span> <span class="s s7">People
who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may
not have been exposed to that.</span> <span class="s s8">Professors and bosses usually feel
some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant
effort and fail, they'll cut you a break.</span> <span class="s s9">Markets are less forgiving.</span>
<span class="s s10">Customers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved
their problems.Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,
not the way bosses evaluate employees.</span> <span class="s s11">If you're making a valiant
effort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but
not this one.</span><span class="s s12">But raising money from investors is harder than selling to
customers, because there are so few of them.</span> <span class="s s13">There's
nothing like an efficient market.</span> <span class="s s14">You're unlikely to have more
than 10 who are interested; it's difficult to talk to more.</span> <span class="s s15">So the
randomness of any one investor's behavior can really affect you.</span><span class="s s16">Problem number 3: investors are very random.</span> <span class="s s17">All investors, including
us, are by ordinary standards incompetent.</span> <span class="s s18">We constantly have to
make decisions about things we don't understand, and more often
than not we're wrong.</span><span class="s s19">And yet a lot is at stake.</span> <span class="s s20">The amounts invested by different types
of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but
the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is.</span>
<span class="s s21">Investment decisions are big decisions.</span><span class="s s22">That combination&acirc;&#128;&#148;making big decisions about things they don't
understand&acirc;&#128;&#148;tends to make investors very skittish.</span> <span class="s s23">VCs are notorious
for leading founders on.</span> <span class="s s24">Some of the more unscrupulous do it
deliberately.</span> <span class="s s25">But even the most well-intentioned investors can
behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life.</span> <span class="s s26">One day
they're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on
the spot; the next they won't return your phone calls.</span> <span class="s s27">They're not
playing games with you.</span> <span class="s s28">They just can't make up their minds.</span>
<span class="s s29">[1]If that weren't bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all
linked together.</span> <span class="s s30">Startup investors all know one another, and (though
they hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you
is the opinion of other investors.</span> 
<span class="s s31">[2]
Talk about a recipe for
an unstable system.</span> <span class="s s32">You get the opposite of the damping that the
fear/greed balance usually produces in markets.</span> <span class="s s33">No one is interested
in a startup that's a "bargain" because everyone else hates it.</span><span class="s s34">So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players
is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.</span>
<span class="s s35">The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled
sea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing
contracts violently.</span><span class="s s36">Y Combinator is working to fix this.</span> <span class="s s37">We're trying to increase the
number of investors just as we're increasing the number of startups.</span>
<span class="s s38">We hope that as the number of both increases we'll get something
more like an efficient market.</span> <span class="s s39">As t approaches infinity, Demo Day
approaches an auction.</span><span class="s s40">Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity.</span> <span class="s s41">What does a
startup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit?</span> <span class="s s42">The
most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down.</span> <span class="s s43">Startups
live or die on morale.</span> <span class="s s44">If you let the difficulty of raising money
destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</span><span class="s s45">Bootstrapping (= Consulting)Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors
at all?</span> <span class="s s46">If raising money is so painful, why do it?</span><span class="s s47">One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on.</span>
<span class="s s48">It's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own
revenues, but you can't create instant customers.</span> <span class="s s49">Whatever you
make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even.</span> <span class="s s50">It will
take time to grow your sales to that point, and it's hard to predict,
till you try, how long it will take.</span><span class="s s51">We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example.</span> <span class="s s52">We charged
quite a lot for our software&acirc;&#128;&#148;about $140 per user per month&acirc;&#128;&#148;but
it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even
our paltry costs.</span> <span class="s s53">We didn't have enough saved to live on for a
year.</span><span class="s s54">If you factor out the "bootstrapped" companies that were actually
funded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder
either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b)
began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed
themselves into product companies.</span><span class="s s55">Consulting is the only option you can count on.</span> <span class="s s56">But consulting is
far from free money.</span> <span class="s s57">It's not as painful as raising money from
investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period.</span>
<span class="s s58">Years, probably.</span> <span class="s s59">And for many types of startup, that delay could
be fatal.</span> <span class="s s60">If you're working on something so unusual that no one
else is likely to think of it, you can take your time.</span> <span class="s s61">Joshua
Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on
Wall Street.</span> <span class="s s62">He got away with it because no one else realized it
was a good idea.</span> <span class="s s63">But if you were building something as obviously
necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb,
and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your
time on client work, you were not in a good position.</span><span class="s s64">Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant
territory is one from which few startups emerge alive.</span> <span class="s s65">The mere
fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account
should set off alarm bells.</span> <span class="s s66">If it worked so well, it would be the
norm.</span>
<span class="s s67">[3]Bootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting
cheaper.</span> <span class="s s68">But I don't think we'll ever reach the point where most
startups can do without outside funding.</span> <span class="s s69">Technology tends to
get dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don't.</span><span class="s s70">The upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharp
pain of raising money, or the chronic ache of consulting.</span> <span class="s s71">For a
given total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice,
because new technology is usually more valuable now than later.</span><span class="s s72">But although for most startups raising money will be the lesser
evil, it's still a pretty big evil&acirc;&#128;&#148;so big that it can easily kill
you.</span> <span class="s s73">Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise
money you might have to shut the company down, but because the
process of raising money itself can kill you.</span><span class="s s74">To survive it you need a set of techniques mostly
orthogonal to the ones used in convincing investors, just as mountain
climbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonal
to those used in physically getting up and down mountains.</span><span class="s s75">1.</span> <span class="s s76">Have low expectations.</span><span class="s s77">The reason raising money destroys so many startups' morale is not
simply that it's hard, but that it's so much harder than they
expected.</span> <span class="s s78">What kills you is the disappointment.</span> <span class="s s79">And the lower
your expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.</span><span class="s s80">Startup founders tend to be optimistic.</span> <span class="s s81">This can work well in
technology, at least some of the time, but it's the wrong way to
approach raising money.</span> <span class="s s82">Better to assume investors will always let
you down.</span> <span class="s s83">Acquirers too, while we're at it.</span> <span class="s s84">At YC one of our
secondary mantras is "Deals fall through.</span><span class="s s85">"</span> <span class="s s86">No matter what deal
you have going on, assume it will fall through.</span> <span class="s s87">The predictive
power of this simple rule is amazing.</span><span class="s s88">There will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believe
it will happen, and then to depend on it happening.</span> <span class="s s89">You must resist
this.</span> <span class="s s90">Tie yourself to the mast.</span> <span class="s s91">This is what kills you.</span> <span class="s s92">Deals
do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where
shared plans solidify linearly over time.</span> <span class="s s93">Deals often fall through
at the last moment.</span> <span class="s s94">Often the other party doesn't really think
about what they want till the last moment.</span> <span class="s s95">So you can't use your
everyday intuitions about shared plans as a guide.</span> <span class="s s96">When it comes
to deals, you have to consciously turn them off and become
pathologically cynical.</span><span class="s s97">This is harder to do than it sounds.</span> <span class="s s98">It's very flattering when
eminent investors seem interested in funding you.</span> <span class="s s99">It's easy to
start to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward.</span>
<span class="s s100">But it hardly ever is.</span><span class="s s101">2.</span> <span class="s s102">Keep working on your startup.</span><span class="s s103">It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup
while raising money.</span> <span class="s s104">Actually this is hard to do.</span> <span class="s s105">Most startups
don't manage to.</span><span class="s s106">Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention.</span>
<span class="s s107">Even if you only have one meeting a day with investors, somehow
that one meeting will burn up your whole day.</span> <span class="s s108">It costs not just
the time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back,
and the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about it
afterward.</span><span class="s s109">The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors
is probably to partition the company: to pick one founder to deal
with investors while the others keep the company going.</span> <span class="s s110">This works
better when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when the
leader of the company is not also the lead developer.</span> <span class="s s111">In the best
case, the company keeps moving forward at about half speed.</span><span class="s s112">That's the best case, though.</span> <span class="s s113">More often than not the company comes
to a standstill while raising money.</span> <span class="s s114">And that is dangerous for so
many reasons.</span> <span class="s s115">Raising money always takes longer than you expect.</span>
<span class="s s116">What seems like it's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into
a 4 month interruption.</span> <span class="s s117">That can be very demoralizing.</span> <span class="s s118">And worse
still, it can make you less attractive to investors.</span> <span class="s s119">They want to
invest in companies that are dynamic.</span> <span class="s s120">A company that hasn't done
anything new in 4 months doesn't seem dynamic, so they start to
lose interest.</span> <span class="s s121">Investors rarely grasp this, but much of what
they're responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the
damage done by their own indecision.</span><span class="s s122">The solution: put the startup first.</span> <span class="s s123">Fit meetings with investors
into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than
doing development in the spare moments between meetings with
investors.</span> <span class="s s124">If you keep the company moving forward&acirc;&#128;&#148;releasing new
features, increasing traffic, doing deals, getting written 
about&acirc;&#128;&#148;those investor meetings are more likely to be productive.</span> <span class="s s125">Not just
because your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will
be better for your own morale, which is one of the main ways investors
judge you.</span><span class="s s126">3.</span> <span class="s s127">Be conservative.</span><span class="s s128">As conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative.</span>
<span class="s s129">When things go well you can take risks; when things are bad you
want to play it safe.</span><span class="s s130">I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly.</span>
<span class="s s131">The reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and the
wildly unstable nature of the system you're dealing with, things
probably either already are or could easily become much worse than
they seem.</span><span class="s s132">What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable
offers you funding on reasonable terms, take it.</span> <span class="s s133">There have been
startups that ignored this advice and got away with it&acirc;&#128;&#148;startups
that ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one, and
actually did.</span> <span class="s s134">But in the same position I'd give the same advice
again.</span> <span class="s s135">Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playing
Russian roulette with?</span><span class="s s136">Corollary: if an investor seems interested, don't just let them
sit.</span> <span class="s s137">You can't assume someone interested in investing will stay
interested.</span> <span class="s s138">In fact, you can't even tell (they can't even tell)
if they're really interested till you try to convert that interest
into money.</span> <span class="s s139">So if you have hot prospect, either close them now or
write them off.</span> <span class="s s140">And unless you already have enough funding, that
reduces to: close them now.</span><span class="s s141">Startups don't win by getting great funding rounds, but by making
great products.</span> <span class="s s142">So finish raising money and get
back to work.</span><span class="s s143">4.</span> <span class="s s144">Be flexible.</span><span class="s s145">There are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn't answer: "Who
else are you talking to?</span><span class="s s146">"</span> <span class="s s147">and "How much are you trying to raise?</span><span class="s s148">"</span><span class="s s149">VCs don't expect you to answer the first question.</span> <span class="s s150">They ask it just
in case.</span> 
<span class="s s151">[4]
They do seem to expect an answer to the second.</span> <span class="s s152">But
I don't think you should just tell them a number.</span> <span class="s s153">Not as a way to
play games with them, but because you shouldn't have a fixed
amount you need to raise.</span><span class="s s154">The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an
obsolete one left over from the days when startups were more
expensive.</span> <span class="s s155">A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50
people obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount.</span> <span class="s s156">But few
technology startups are in that position today.</span><span class="s s157">We advise startups to tell investors there are several different
routes they could take depending on how much they raised.</span> <span class="s s158">As little
as $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year.</span>
<span class="s s159">A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire
some smart people they know from school.</span> <span class="s s160">A couple million would
let them really blow this thing out.</span> <span class="s s161">The message (and not just the
message, but the fact) should be: we're going to succeed no matter
what.</span> <span class="s s162">Raising more money just lets us do it faster.</span><span class="s s163">If you're raising an angel round, the size of the round can even
change on the fly.</span> <span class="s s164">In fact, it's just as well to make the round
small initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise
a large round and risk losing the investors you already have if you
can't raise the full amount.</span> <span class="s s165">You may even want to do a "rolling
close," where the round has no predetermined size, but instead you
sell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes.</span> <span class="s s166">That helps
break deadlocks, because you can start as soon as the first one
is ready to buy.</span> 
<span class="s s167">[5]5.</span> <span class="s s168">Be independent.</span><span class="s s169">A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have
expenses so low that they could be profitable on
as little as $2000 per month.</span> <span class="s s170">That's negligible as corporate
revenues go, but the effect on your morale and your bargaining
position is anything but.</span> <span class="s s171">At YC we use the phrase "ramen profitable"
to describe the situation where you're making just enough to pay
your living expenses.</span> <span class="s s172">Once you cross into ramen profitable,
everything changes.</span> <span class="s s173">You may still need investment to make it big,
but you don't need it this month.</span><span class="s s174">You can't plan when you start a startup how long
it will take to become profitable.</span> <span class="s s175">But if you find yourself in a
position where a little more effort expended on sales would carry
you over the threshold of ramen profitable, do it.</span><span class="s s176">Investors like it when you're ramen profitable.</span> <span class="s s177">It shows you've
thought about making money, instead of just working on amusing
technical problems; it shows you have the discipline to keep your
expenses low; but above all, it means you don't need them.</span><span class="s s178">There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems like
it's going to succeed even without them.</span> <span class="s s179">Investors like it when
they can help a startup, but they don't like startups that would
die without that help.</span><span class="s s180">At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we've
funded will do, because we're trying to learn how to pick winners.</span>
<span class="s s181">We've now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we're
getting better at predicting them.</span> <span class="s s182">And when we're talking
about startups we think are likely to succeed, what we find ourselves
saying is things like "Oh, those guys can take care of themselves.</span>
<span class="s s183">They'll be fine.</span><span class="s s184">"</span> <span class="s s185">Not "those guys are really smart" or
"those guys are working on a great idea.</span><span class="s s186">"</span>
<span class="s s187">[6]
When we predict good outcomes for startups, the qualities
that come up in the supporting arguments are toughness, adaptability,
determination.</span> <span class="s s188">Which means to the extent we're correct, those are
the qualities you need to win.</span><span class="s s189">Investors know this, at least unconsciously.</span> <span class="s s190">The reason they like
it when you don't need them is not simply that they like what they
can't have, but because that quality is what makes founders succeed.</span><span class="s s191">Sam Altman 
has it.</span> <span class="s s192">You could parachute him into an island full of
cannibals and come back in 5 years and he'd be the king.</span> <span class="s s193">If you're
Sam Altman, you don't have to be profitable to convey to investors
that you'll succeed with or without them.</span> <span class="s s194">(He wasn't, and he did.</span><span class="s s195">)
Not everyone has Sam's deal-making ability.</span> <span class="s s196">I myself don't.</span> <span class="s s197">But
if you don't, you can let the numbers speak for you.</span><span class="s s198">6.</span> <span class="s s199">Don't take rejection personally.</span><span class="s s200">Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself.</span>
<span class="s s201">After all, they're more experienced than you.</span> <span class="s s202">If they think your
startup is lame, aren't they probably right?</span><span class="s s203">Maybe, maybe not.</span> <span class="s s204">The way to handle rejection is with precision.</span>
<span class="s s205">You shouldn't simply ignore rejection.</span> <span class="s s206">It might mean something.</span>
<span class="s s207">But you shouldn't automatically get demoralized either.</span><span class="s s208">To understand what rejection means, you have to understand first
of all how common it is.</span> <span class="s s209">Statistically, the average VC is a rejection
machine.</span> <span class="s s210">David Hornik, a partner at August, told me:
 The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans
 received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour
 meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about
 5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals
 done in a year.</span> <span class="s s211">So the odds are against you.</span> <span class="s s212">You
 may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc.</span>
 <span class="s s213">but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded.</span>
<span class="s s214">This is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone.</span>
<span class="s s215">The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new
investments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.</span><span class="s s216">In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is,
as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups.</span> <span class="s s217">It's harder to
judge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas
tend to seem wrong.</span> <span class="s s218">A good startup idea has to be not just good but
novel.</span> <span class="s s219">And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seem
bad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and it
wouldn't be novel.</span><span class="s s220">That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges.</span>
<span class="s s221">You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup
investor.</span> <span class="s s222">That's a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularly
imaginative.</span> <span class="s s223">VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.</span>
<span class="s s224">[7]
Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most
were founders themselves.</span><span class="s s225">So when you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, and not what's
not.</span> <span class="s s226">If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing,
look at your startup and ask if they're right.</span> <span class="s s227">If they're real
problems, fix them.</span> <span class="s s228">But don't just take their word for it.</span> <span class="s s229">You're
supposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.</span><span class="s s230">Though a rejection doesn't necessarily tell you anything about your
startup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved.</span> <span class="s s231">Figure out
what's not working and change it.</span> <span class="s s232">Don't just think "investors are
stupid.</span><span class="s s233">"</span> <span class="s s234">Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose
them.</span><span class="s s235">Don't let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap.</span>
<span class="s s236">Sort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking "no one
likes us," you'll know precisely how big a problem you have, and
what to do about it.</span><span class="s s237">7.</span> <span class="s s238">Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).</span><span class="s s239">Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup.</span>
<span class="s s240">But it's better than dying.</span> <span class="s s241">It's a bit like anaerobic respiration:
not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save you
from an immediate threat.</span> <span class="s s242">If you're having trouble raising money
from investors at all, it could save you to be able to shift
toward consulting.</span><span class="s s243">This works better for some startups than others.</span> <span class="s s244">It wouldn't have
been a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was making
software for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefully
into consulting by building sites for clients with it.</span><span class="s s245">So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into
consulting, this could even have advantages.</span> <span class="s s246">You'd understand your
users well if you were using the software for them.</span> <span class="s s247">Plus as a
consulting company you might be able to get big-name users using
your software that you wouldn't have gotten as a product company.</span><span class="s s248">At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company
initially, because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer
to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up.</span> 
<span class="s s249">But we never charged for such work, because we didn't want them to
start treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every
time they wanted something changed on their site.</span> <span class="s s250">We knew we had
to stay a product company, because only
that scales.</span><span class="s s251">8.</span> <span class="s s252">Avoid inexperienced investors.</span><span class="s s253">Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most
dangerous sort, because they're so nervous.</span> <span class="s s254">Especially in
proportion to the amount they invest.</span> <span class="s s255">Raising $20,000 from a first-time
angel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from
a VC fund.</span><span class="s s256">Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too.</span> <span class="s s257">But while the
investors can admit they don't know what they're doing, their lawyers
can't.</span> <span class="s s258">One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with
an angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer.</span> <span class="s s259">And
since the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, that
he'd screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all the
draconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.</span><span class="s s260">Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there
would never be any experienced ones.</span> <span class="s s261">But if you do, either (a)
drive the process yourself, including supplying the 
paperwork, or
(b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.</span><span class="s s262">9.</span> <span class="s s263">Know where you stand.</span><span class="s s264">The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness.</span>
<span class="s s265">The worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes after
months of meetings.</span> <span class="s s266">Rejections from investors are like design
flaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.</span><span class="s s267">So while you're talking to investors, constantly look for signs of
where you stand.</span> <span class="s s268">How likely are they to offer you a term sheet?</span>
<span class="s s269">What do they have to be convinced of first?</span> <span class="s s270">You shouldn't necessarily
always be asking these questions outright&acirc;&#128;&#148;that could get 
annoying&acirc;&#128;&#148;but you should always be collecting data about them.</span><span class="s s271">Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push
them to.</span> <span class="s s272">It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of
information while making the minimum number of decisions.</span> <span class="s s273">The best
way to force them to act is, of course, competing investors.</span> <span class="s s274">But
you can also apply some force by focusing the discussion:
by asking what specific questions they need answered to make
up their minds, and then answering them.</span> <span class="s s275">If you get through several
obstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimately
they're going to flake.</span><span class="s s276">You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors'
intentions.</span> <span class="s s277">Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine
with your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate
impressions.</span><span class="s s278">Use the data to weight your strategy.</span>
<span class="s s279">You'll probably be talking to several investors.</span> <span class="s s280">Focus on the ones
that are most likely to say yes.</span> <span class="s s281">The value of a potential investor
is a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and how
likely they are to say it.</span> <span class="s s282">Put the most weight on the second factor.</span>
<span class="s s283">Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply
investing.</span> <span class="s s284">But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor
in investors' opinion of you is other investors' opinion of you.</span>
<span class="s s285">If you're talking to several investors and you manage to get one
over the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more
interested.</span> <span class="s s286">So you're not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if
you focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the best
way to convince the lukewarm ones.</span><span class="s s287">FutureI'm hopeful things won't always be so awkward.</span> <span class="s s288">I hope that as startups
get cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising money
will become, if not easy, at least straightforward.</span><span class="s s289">In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a big
opportunity.</span> <span class="s s290">Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are.</span>
<span class="s s291">They'd be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something
that has to be treated as a threat to a company's survival.</span> <span class="s s292">They
just think they need a little more information to make up their
minds.</span> <span class="s s293">They don't get that there are 10 other investors who also
want a little more information, and that the process of talking to
them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.</span><span class="s s294">Because investors don't understand the cost of dealing with them,
they don't realize how much room there is for a potential competitor
to undercut them.</span> <span class="s s295">I know from my own experience how much faster
investors could decide, because we've brought our own time down to
20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute
interview plus 5 minutes of discussion).</span> <span class="s s296">If you were investing
more money you'd want to take longer, of course.</span> <span class="s s297">But if we can
decide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a couple
days?</span><span class="s s298">Opportunities like this don't sit unexploited forever, even in an
industry as conservative as venture capital.</span> <span class="s s299">So
either existing investors will start to make up their minds faster,
or new investors will emerge who do.</span><span class="s s300">In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous
process.</span> <span class="s s301">Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here.</span>
<span class="s s302">The biggest danger is surprise.</span> <span class="s s303">It's that startups will underestimate
the difficulty of raising money&acirc;&#128;&#148;that they'll cruise through all
the initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they'll find
it surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up.</span> <span class="s s304">So I'm telling
you in advance: raising money is hard.</span><span class="s s305">Notes[1]
When investors can't make up their minds, they sometimes
describe it as if it were a property of the startup.</span> <span class="s s306">"You're too
early for us," they sometimes say.</span> <span class="s s307">But which of them, if they were
taken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded, wouldn't
offer to invest at any valuation the founders chose?</span> <span class="s s308">An hour old
is not too early if it's the right startup.</span> <span class="s s309">What "you're too early"
really means is "we can't figure out yet whether you'll succeed.</span><span class="s s310">"</span><span class="s s311">[2]
Investors influence one another both directly and indirectly.</span>
<span class="s s312">They influence one another directly through the "buzz" that surrounds
a hot startup.</span> <span class="s s313">But they also influence one another indirectly
through the founders.</span> <span class="s s314">When a lot of investors are interested in
you, it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more
attractive to investors.</span><span class="s s315">No VC will admit they're influenced by buzz.</span> <span class="s s316">Some genuinely aren't.</span>
<span class="s s317">But there are few who can say they're not influenced by confidence.</span><span class="s s318">[3]
One VC who read this essay wrote:"We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting.</span> 
<span class="s s319">It creates very bad behaviors/instincts that are hard to erase 
from a company's culture.</span><span class="s s320">"</span><span class="s s321">[4]
The optimal way to answer the first question is to say that
it would be improper to name names, while simultaneously implying
that you're talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to
give you term sheets.</span> <span class="s s322">If you're the sort of person who understands
how to do that, go ahead.</span> <span class="s s323">If not, don't even try.</span> <span class="s s324">Nothing annoys
VCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them.</span><span class="s s325">[5]
The disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the
valuation is fixed at the start, so if you get a sudden rush of
interest, you may have to decide between turning some investors
away and selling more of the company than you meant to.</span> <span class="s s326">That's a
good problem to have, however.</span><span class="s s327">[6]
I wouldn't say that intelligence doesn't matter in startups.</span>
<span class="s s328">We're only comparing YC startups, who've already made it over a
certain threshold.</span><span class="s s329">[7]
But not all are.</span> <span class="s s330">Though most VCs are suits at heart,
the most successful ones tend not to be.</span> <span class="s s331">Oddly enough,
the best VCs tend to be the least VC-like.</span><span class="s s332">Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, David Hornik, Jessica Livingston,
