  <h2><span class="s s1">The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
October 2006</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">In the Q &amp; A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made
startups fail.</span> <span class="s s4">After standing there gaping for a few seconds I
realized this was kind of a trick question.</span> <span class="s s5">It's equivalent to
asking how to make a startup succeed&mdash;if you avoid every cause of
failure, you succeed&mdash;and that's too big a question to answer on
the fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem
from this direction.</span> <span class="s s7">If you have a list of all the things you
shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just
by negating.</span> <span class="s s8">And this form of list may be more useful in practice.</span>
<span class="s s9">It's easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn't than
always to remember to do something you should.</span>
<span class="s s10">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making
something users want.</span> <span class="s s12">If you make something users want, you'll
probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do.</span> <span class="s s13">And if you
don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else
you do or don't do.</span> <span class="s s14">So really this is a list of 18 things that
cause startups not to make something users want.</span> <span class="s s15">Nearly all failure
funnels through that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">1. Single Founder</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by
just one person?</span> <span class="s s18">Even companies you think of as having one founder,
like Oracle, usually turn out to have more.</span> <span class="s s19">It seems unlikely this
is a coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">What's wrong with having one founder?</span> <span class="s s21">To start with, it's a vote
of no confidence.</span> <span class="s s22">It probably means the founder couldn't talk any
of his friends into starting the company with him.</span> <span class="s s23">That's pretty
alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company
is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage.</span> <span class="s s25">Starting a startup
is too hard for one person.</span> <span class="s s26">Even if you could do all the work
yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out
of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">The last one might be the most important.</span> <span class="s s28">The low points in a
startup are so low that few could bear them alone.</span> <span class="s s29">When you have
multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way
that seems to violate conservation laws.</span> <span class="s s30">Each thinks "I can't let
my friends down.</span><span class="s s31">"</span> <span class="s s32">This is one of the most powerful forces in human
nature, and it's missing when there's just one founder.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">2. Bad Location</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">Startups prosper in some places and not others.</span> <span class="s s35">Silicon Valley
dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York.</span> <span class="s s36">After
that there's not much.</span> <span class="s s37">Even in New York the number of startups per
capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s38">In towns
like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">Why is the falloff so sharp?</span> <span class="s s40">Probably for the same reason it is
in other industries.</span> <span class="s s41">What's the sixth largest fashion center in
the US?</span> <span class="s s42">The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing?</span>
<span class="s s43">Whatever they are they're probably so far from the top that it would
be misleading even to call them centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">It's an interesting question why cities 
become startup hubs, but
the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is
for any industry: that's where the experts are.</span> <span class="s s45">Standards are
higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind
of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries
are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the
same business.</span> <span class="s s46">Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost
startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's
clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">3. Marginal Niche</span></p>
<p><span class="s s48">Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common
problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding
competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a
certain age they're afraid of the ball.</span> <span class="s s50">When the ball comes near
them their instinct is to avoid it.</span> <span class="s s51">I didn't make a lot of catches
as an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came
my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for
protection than in the hope of catching it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight
year old strategy for dealing with fly balls.</span> <span class="s s53">If you make anything
good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face
that.</span> <span class="s s54">You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious.</span>
<span class="s s56">It's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue
smaller ones because they seem safer.</span> <span class="s s57">Your unconscious won't even
let you think of grand ideas.</span> <span class="s s58">So the solution may be to think about
ideas without involving yourself.</span> <span class="s s59">What would be a great idea for
someone else to do as a startup?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">4. Derivative Idea</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing
company.</span> <span class="s s62">That's one source of ideas, but not the best.</span> <span class="s s63">If you
look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in
imitation of some other startup.</span> <span class="s s64">Where did they get their ideas?</span>
<span class="s s65">Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">Our startup made software for making online stores.</span> <span class="s s67">When we started
it, there wasn't any; the few sites you could order from were
hand-made at great expense by web consultants.</span> <span class="s s68">We knew that if
online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated
by software, so we wrote some.</span> <span class="s s69">Pretty straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you
personally.</span> <span class="s s71">Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer,
Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find stuff online, Hotmail
because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn't exchange email at
work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the
Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction.</span>
<span class="s s73">Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems
they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might
solve them.</span> 
<span class="s s74">[2]
What do people complain about?</span> <span class="s s75">What do you wish there was?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">5. Obstinacy</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you
want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you
encounter.</span> <span class="s s78">Starting startups is not one of them.</span> <span class="s s79">The stick-to-your-vision
approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,
where the problem is well-defined.</span> <span class="s s80">Startups are more like science,
where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">So don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's
probably wrong.</span> <span class="s s82">Most successful startups end up doing something
different than they originally intended&mdash;often so different that
it doesn't even seem like the same company.</span> <span class="s s83">You have to be prepared
to see the better idea when it arrives.</span> <span class="s s84">And the hardest part of
that is often discarding your old idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right.</span> <span class="s s86">Switching
to a new idea every week will be equally fatal.</span> <span class="s s87">Is there some kind
of external test you can use?</span> <span class="s s88">One is to ask whether the ideas
represent some kind of progression.</span> <span class="s s89">If in each new idea you're
able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then
you're probably in a process that converges.</span> <span class="s s90">Whereas if you keep
restarting from scratch, that's a bad sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">Fortunately there's someone you can ask for advice: your users.</span> <span class="s s92">If
you're thinking about turning in some new direction and your users
seem excited about it, it's probably a good bet.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">6. Hiring Bad Programmers</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list,
because nearly all the founders I know are programmers.</span> <span class="s s95">This is
not a serious problem for them.</span> <span class="s s96">They might accidentally hire someone
bad, but it's not going to kill the company.</span> <span class="s s97">In a pinch they can
do whatever's required themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the
e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers.</span> <span class="s s99">A lot
of those companies were started by business guys who thought the
way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired
programmers to implement it.</span> <span class="s s100">That's actually much harder than it
sounds&mdash;almost impossibly hard in fact&mdash;because business guys
can't tell which are the good programmers.</span> <span class="s s101">They don't even get a
shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job
implementing the vision of a business guy.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s102">In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people
they think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that
he's a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren't.</span> <span class="s s103">Then they're
mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War
II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters.</span>
<span class="s s104">This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company,
but without the advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s105">So how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer?</span> <span class="s s106">I
don't think there's an answer.</span> <span class="s s107">I was about to say you'd have to
find a good programmer to help you hire people.</span> <span class="s s108">But if you can't
recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">7. Choosing the Wrong Platform</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">A related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers)
is choosing the wrong platform.</span> <span class="s s111">For example, I think a lot of
startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build
server-based applications on Windows.</span> <span class="s s112">Hotmail was still running
on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because
Windows couldn't handle the load.</span> <span class="s s113">If Hotmail's founders
had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">PayPal only just dodged this bullet.</span> <span class="s s115">After they merged with X.</span><span class="s s116">com,
the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows&mdash;even after PayPal cofounder
Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on
Windows as Unix.</span> <span class="s s117">Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">Platform is a vague word.</span> <span class="s s119">It could mean an operating system, or a
programming language, or a "framework" built on top of a programming
language.</span> <span class="s s120">It implies something that both supports and limits, like
the foundation of a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s121">The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that
seem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, like
Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them.</span> <span class="s s122">Java
applets were probably the most spectacular example.</span> <span class="s s123">This was
supposed to be the new way of delivering applications.</span> <span class="s s124">Presumably
it killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">How do you pick the right platforms?</span> <span class="s s126">The usual way is to hire good
programmers and let them choose.</span> <span class="s s127">But there is a trick you could
use if you're not a programmer: visit a top computer science
department and see what they use in research projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">8. Slowness in Launching</span></p>
<p><span class="s s129">Companies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done.</span> <span class="s s130">It's
intrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done.</span> <span class="s s131">It takes an
effort of will to push through this and get something released to
users.</span>
<span class="s s132">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s133">Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch.</span> <span class="s s134">Most
are equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday
life.</span> <span class="s s135">There's something that needs to happen first.</span> <span class="s s136">Maybe.</span> <span class="s s137">But
if the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push
of a button, would they still be waiting?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s138">One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually
finish some quantum of work.</span> <span class="s s139">Nothing is truly finished till it's
released; you can see that from the rush of work that's always
involved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought
it was.</span> <span class="s s140">The other reason you need to launch is that it's only by
bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching:
working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of
having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too
many different things; excessive perfectionism.</span> <span class="s s142">Fortunately you
can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself
to launch something fairly quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s143">9. Launching Too Early</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">Launching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more
startups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch too
fast.</span> <span class="s s145">The danger here is that you ruin your reputation.</span> <span class="s s146">You launch
something, the early adopters try it out, and if it's no good they
may never come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s147">So what's the minimum you need to launch?</span> <span class="s s148">We suggest startups think
about what they plan to do, identify a core that's both (a) useful
on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded
into the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s149">This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for
writing software.</span> <span class="s s150">Think about the overall goal, then start by
writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful.</span> <span class="s s151">If
it's a subset, you'll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case
you won't be wasting your time.</span> <span class="s s152">But more likely you'll find that
implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you
see more clearly what the rest should do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant.</span> <span class="s s154">They
don't expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just has
to do something.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s155">10. Having No Specific User in Mind</span></p>
<p><span class="s s156">You can't build things users like without understanding them.</span> <span class="s s157">I
mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have
begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had.</span> <span class="s s158">Perhaps
there's a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how
well you understand the problem you're solving, and the problems
you understand best are your own.</span> 
<span class="s s159">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s160">That's just a theory. What's not a theory is the converse: if
you're trying to solve problems you don't understand, you're hosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to
assume that someone, they're not sure exactly who, will want what
they're building.</span> <span class="s s162">Do the founders want it?</span> <span class="s s163">No, they're not the
target market.</span> <span class="s s164">Who is?</span> <span class="s s165">Teenagers.</span> <span class="s s166">People interested in local
events (that one is a perennial tarpit).</span> <span class="s s167">Or "business" users.</span> <span class="s s168">What
business users?</span> <span class="s s169">Gas stations?</span> <span class="s s170">Movie studios?</span> <span class="s s171">Defense contractors?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">You can of course build something for users other than yourself.</span>
<span class="s s173">We did.</span> <span class="s s174">But you should realize you're stepping into dangerous
territory.</span> <span class="s s175">You're flying on instruments, in effect, so you should
(a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on
your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the
instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s176">In this case the instruments are the users.</span> <span class="s s177">When designing for
other people you have to be empirical.</span> <span class="s s178">You can no longer guess
what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses.</span>
<span class="s s179">So if you're going to make something for teenagers or "business"
users or some other group that doesn't include you, you have to be
able to talk some specific ones into using what you're making.</span> <span class="s s180">If
you can't, you're on the wrong track.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s181">11. Raising Too Little Money</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">Most successful startups take funding at some point.</span> <span class="s s183">Like having
more than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically.</span> <span class="s s184">How much
should you take, though?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s185">Startup funding is measured in time.</span> <span class="s s186">Every startup that isn't
profitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certain
amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop.</span>
<span class="s s187">This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in "How much runway do
you have left?</span><span class="s s188">"</span> <span class="s s189">It's a good metaphor because it reminds you that
when the money runs out you're going to be airborne or dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s190">Too little money means not enough to get airborne.</span> <span class="s s191">What airborne
means depends on the situation.</span> <span class="s s192">Usually you have to advance to a
visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype;
if you have a prototype, launching; if you're launched, significant
growth.</span> <span class="s s193">It depends on investors, because until you're profitable
that's who you have to convince.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s194">So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get
to the next step, whatever that is.</span>
<span class="s s195">[5]
Fortunately you have some
control over both how much you spend and what the next step is.</span> <span class="s s196">We
advise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically
nothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype.</span>
<span class="s s197">This gives you maximum flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">12. Spending Too Much</span></p>
<p><span class="s s199">It's hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little.</span>
<span class="s s200">If you run out of money, you could say either was the cause.</span> <span class="s s201">The
only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other
startups.</span> <span class="s s202">If you raised five million and ran out of money, you
probably spent too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s203">Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be.</span>
<span class="s s204">Founders seem to have learned that lesson.</span> <span class="s s205">Plus it keeps getting
cheaper to start a startup.</span> <span class="s s206">So as of this writing few startups
spend too much.</span> <span class="s s207">None of the ones we've funded have.</span> <span class="s s208">(And not just
because we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further
rounds.</span><span class="s s209">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s210">The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people.</span>
<span class="s s211">This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows
you down&mdash;so money that's getting consumed faster has to last
longer.</span> <span class="s s212">Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks
explained it in The Mythical Man-Month.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don't do it if
you can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary,
not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who
are committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who
are either going to write code or go out and get users, because
those are the only things you need at first.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s214">13. Raising Too Much Money</span></p>
<p><span class="s s215">It's obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such
a thing as having too much?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s216">Yes and no.</span> <span class="s s217">The problem is not so much the money itself as what
comes with it.</span> <span class="s s218">As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, "Once you
take several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking.</span><span class="s s219">"</span>
<span class="s s220">If VCs fund you, they're not going to let you just put the money
in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen.</span> <span class="s s221">They
want that money to go to work.</span> 
<span class="s s222">[6]
At the very least you'll move
into proper office space and hire more people.</span> <span class="s s223">That will change
the atmosphere, and not entirely for the better.</span> <span class="s s224">Now most of your
people will be employees rather than founders.</span> <span class="s s225">They won't be as
committed; they'll need to be told what to do; they'll start to
engage in office politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s226">When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs
and has kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s227">Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets
harder to change direction.</span> <span class="s s228">Suppose your initial plan was to sell
something to companies.</span> <span class="s s229">After taking VC money you hire a sales
force to do that.</span> <span class="s s230">What happens now if you realize you should be
making this for consumers instead of businesses?</span> <span class="s s231">That's a completely
different kind of selling.</span> <span class="s s232">What happens, in practice, is that you
don't realize that.</span> <span class="s s233">The more people you have, the more you stay
pointed in the same direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s234">Another drawback of large investments is the time they take.</span> <span class="s s235">The
time required to raise money grows with the amount.</span>
<span class="s s236">[7]
When the
amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious.</span> <span class="s s237">VCs
never quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently
endless conversation.</span> <span class="s s238">Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge
time sink&mdash;more work, probably, than the startup itself.</span> <span class="s s239">And you
don't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while
your competitors are spending theirs building things.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s240">We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first
reasonable deal they get.</span> <span class="s s241">If you get an offer from a reputable
firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms,
just take it and get on with building the company.</span>
<span class="s s242">[8]
Who cares
if you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere?</span> <span class="s s243">Economically, startups
are an all-or-nothing game.</span> <span class="s s244">Bargain-hunting among investors is a
waste of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s245">14. Poor Investor Management</span></p>
<p><span class="s s246">As a founder, you have to manage your investors.</span> <span class="s s247">You shouldn't
ignore them, because they may have useful insights.</span> <span class="s s248">But neither
should you let them run the company.</span> <span class="s s249">That's supposed to be your
job.</span> <span class="s s250">If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies
they fund, why didn't they start them?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s251">Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous
than caving in to them.</span> <span class="s s252">In our startup, we erred on the ignoring
side.</span> <span class="s s253">A lot of our energy got drained
away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product.</span>
<span class="s s254">But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have
destroyed the company.</span> <span class="s s255">If the founders know what they're doing,
it's better to have half their attention focused on the product
than the full attention of investors who don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s256">How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on
how much money you've taken.</span> <span class="s s257">When you raise VC-scale money, the
investors get a great deal of control.</span> <span class="s s258">If they have a board majority,
they're literally your bosses.</span> <span class="s s259">In the more common case, where
founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding
vote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors have
to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s260">If things go well, this shouldn't matter.</span> <span class="s s261">So long as you seem to
be advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone.</span> <span class="s s262">But
things don't always go smoothly in startups.</span> <span class="s s263">Investors have made
trouble even for the most successful companies.</span> <span class="s s264">One of the most
famous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder
in firing Steve Jobs.</span> <span class="s s265">Apparently even Google got a lot of grief
from their investors early on.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s266">15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit</span></p>
<p><span class="s s267">When I said at the beginning that if you make something users want,
you'll be fine, you may have noticed I didn't mention anything about
having the right business model.</span> <span class="s s268">That's not because making money
is unimportant.</span> <span class="s s269">I'm not suggesting that founders start companies
with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before
they tank.</span> <span class="s s270">The reason we tell founders not to worry about the
business model initially is that making something people want is
so much harder.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s271">I don't know why it's so hard to make something people want.</span> <span class="s s272">It
seems like it should be straightforward.</span> <span class="s s273">But you can tell it must
be hard by how few startups do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s274">Because making something people want is so much harder than making
money from it, you should leave business models for later, just as
you'd leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2.</span> <span class="s s275">In version
1, solve the core problem.</span> <span class="s s276">And the core problem in a startup is
how to create wealth 
(= how much people want something x the number
who want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s277">The companies that win are the ones that put users first.</span> <span class="s s278">Google,
for example.</span> <span class="s s279">They made search work, then worried about how to make
money from it.</span> <span class="s s280">And yet some startup founders still think it's
irresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning.</span>
<span class="s s281">They're often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes
from less malleable industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s282">It is irresponsible not to think about business models. It's
just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s283">16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty</span></p>
<p><span class="s s284">Nearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code
and have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money
from it.</span> <span class="s s285">And not just the lazy ones.</span> <span class="s s286">Larry and Sergey apparently
felt this way too at first.</span> <span class="s s287">After developing their new search
algorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company
to buy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s288">Start a company?</span> <span class="s s289">Yech.</span> <span class="s s290">Most hackers would rather just have ideas.</span>
<span class="s s291">But as Larry and Sergey found, there's not much of a market for
ideas.</span> <span class="s s292">No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and
use that to grow a user base.</span> <span class="s s293">Then they'll pay big time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s294">Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much.</span> <span class="s s295">There's
nothing like users for convincing acquirers.</span> <span class="s s296">It's not just that
the risk is decreased.</span> <span class="s s297">The acquirers are human, and they have a
hard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for
being clever.</span> <span class="s s298">When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot
of users, they can tell themselves they're buying the users rather
than the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow.</span>
<span class="s s299">[9]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s300">If you're going to attract users, you'll probably have to get up
from your computer and go find some.</span> <span class="s s301">It's unpleasant work, but if
you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of
succeeding.</span> <span class="s s302">In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer
of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their
applications.</span> <span class="s s303">But there was one who was away half the time talking
to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals.</span>
<span class="s s304">Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker?</span>
<span class="s s305">[10]
But it
paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that
group by an order of magnitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s306">If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you
can't just hack.</span> <span class="s s307">At least one hacker will have to spend some of
the time doing business stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s308">17. Fights Between Founders</span></p>
<p><span class="s s309">Fights between founders are surprisingly common.</span> <span class="s s310">About 20% of the
startups we've funded have had a founder leave.</span> <span class="s s311">It happens so often
that we've reversed our attitude to vesting.</span> <span class="s s312">We still don't require
it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly
way for people to quit.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s313">A founder leaving doesn't necessarily kill a startup, though.</span> <span class="s s314">Plenty
of successful startups have had that happen.</span> 
<span class="s s315">[11]
Fortunately it's
usually the least committed founder who leaves.</span> <span class="s s316">If there are three
founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.</span> <span class="s s317">If you have
two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves,
that's more of a problem.</span> <span class="s s318">But even that is survivable.</span> <span class="s s319">Blogger
got down to one person, and they bounced back.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s320">Most of the disputes I've seen between founders could have been
avoided if they'd been more careful about who they started a company
with.</span> <span class="s s321">Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people.</span>
<span class="s s322">Which means they're inevitable.</span> <span class="s s323">And most founders who've been
burned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed,
when they started the company.</span> <span class="s s324">Don't suppress misgivings.</span> <span class="s s325">It's
much easier to fix problems before the company is started than
after.</span> <span class="s s326">So don't include your housemate in your startup because
he'd feel left out otherwise.</span> <span class="s s327">Don't start a company with someone
you dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you
won't find anyone else.</span> <span class="s s328">The people are the most important ingredient
in a startup, so don't compromise there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s329">18. A Half-Hearted Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="s s330">The failed startups you hear most about are the spectactular
flameouts.</span> <span class="s s331">Those are actually the elite of failures.</span> <span class="s s332">The most
common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the
one that doesn't do much of anything&mdash;the one we never even hear
about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the
side while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere
and was gradually abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s333">Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the
most important thing is to quit your day job.</span> <span class="s s334">Most founders of
failed startups don't quit their day jobs, and most founders of
successful ones do.</span> <span class="s s335">If startup failure were a disease, the CDC
would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s336">Does that mean you should quit your day job?</span> <span class="s s337">Not necessarily.</span> <span class="s s338">I'm
guessing here, but I'd guess that many of these would-be founders
may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company,
and that in the back of their minds, they know it.</span> <span class="s s339">The reason they
don't invest more time in their startup is that they know it's a
bad investment.</span>
<span class="s s340">[12]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s341">I'd also guess there's some band of people who could have succeeded
if they'd taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn't.</span> <span class="s s342">I have
no idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless
progression has the sort of distribution you'd expect, the number
of people who could have made it, if they'd quit their day job, is
probably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make
it.</span>
<span class="s s343">[13]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s344">If that's true, most startups that could succeed fail because the
founders don't devote their whole efforts to them.</span> <span class="s s345">That certainly
accords with what I see out in the world.</span> <span class="s s346">Most startups fail because
they don't make something people want, and the reason most don't
is that they don't try hard enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s347">In other words, starting startups is just like everything else.</span>
<span class="s s348">The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough.</span> <span class="s s349">To the
extent there's a secret to success, it's not to be in denial about
that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s350">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s351">[1]
This is not a complete list of the causes of failure,
just those you can control.</span> <span class="s s352">There are also several you can't,
notably ineptitude and bad luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s353">[2]
Ironically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a
facebook exclusively for college students.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s354">[3]
Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying "Real artists
ship.</span><span class="s s355">"</span> <span class="s s356">This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not true.</span> <span class="s s357">Many
famous works of art are unfinished.</span> <span class="s s358">It's true in fields that have
hard deadlines, like architecture and filmmaking, but even there
people tend to be tweaking stuff till it's yanked out of their
hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s359">[4]
There's probably also a second factor: startup founders tend
to be at the leading edge of technology, so problems they face are
probably especially valuable.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s360">[5]
You should take more than you think you'll need, maybe 50% to
100% more, because software takes longer to write and deals longer
to close than you expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s361">[6]
Since people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we're
not.</span> <span class="s s362">VCs invest large amounts of other people's money.</span> <span class="s s363">We invest
small amounts of our own, like angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s364">[7]
Not linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five
million dollars. In practice it just feels like it takes forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s365">Though if you include the cases where VCs don't invest, it would
literally take forever in the median case.</span> <span class="s s366">And maybe we should,
because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that
they take a long time.</span> <span class="s s367">That's the best case.</span> <span class="s s368">The real danger
is that you'll expend a lot of time and get nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s369">[8]
Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see
if you have the balls to ask for more.</span> <span class="s s370">It's lame that VCs play
such games, but some do.</span> <span class="s s371">If you're dealing with one of those you
should push back on the valuation a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s372">[9]
Suppose YouTube's founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told
them "Google Video is badly designed.</span> <span class="s s373">Give us $10 million and we'll
tell you all the mistakes you made.</span><span class="s s374">"</span> <span class="s s375">They would have gotten
the royal raspberry.</span> <span class="s s376">Eighteen months later Google paid $1.</span><span class="s s377">6 billion
for the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves
that they were buying a phenomenon, or a community, or some vague
thing like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s378">I don't mean to be hard on Google. They did better than their
competitors, who may have now missed the video boat entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s379">[10]
Yes, actually: dealing with the government. But phone companies
are up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s380">[11]
Many more than most people realize, because companies don't advertise
this. Did you know Apple originally had three founders?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s381">[12]
I'm not dissing these people.</span> <span class="s s382">I don't have the determination
myself.</span> <span class="s s383">I've twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb,
and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur
of poverty I just wasn't willing to endure the stress of a startup.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s384">[13]
So how do you know whether you're in the category of people
who should quit their day job, or the presumably larger one who
shouldn't?</span> <span class="s s385">I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge
for yourself and that you should seek outside advice, before realizing
that that's what we do.</span> <span class="s s386">We think of ourselves as investors, but
viewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for
advising people whether or not to quit their day job.</span> <span class="s s387">We could be
mistaken, and no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on
our conclusions.</span></p>
