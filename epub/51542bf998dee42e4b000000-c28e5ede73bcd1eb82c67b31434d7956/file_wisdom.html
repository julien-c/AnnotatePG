  <h2><span class="s s1">Is It Worth Being Wise?</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">February 2007</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about
for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.</span>
<span class="s s4">Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are
smart, but not very wise.</span> <span class="s s5">And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem
related.</span> <span class="s s6">How?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">What is wisdom?</span> <span class="s s8">I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of
situations.</span> <span class="s s9">I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the
true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.</span> <span class="s s10">A
wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain
situations?</span> <span class="s s12">For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells
your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?</span>
<span class="s s13">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of
problems&mdash;wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract
ones.</span> <span class="s s15">But that isn't true.</span> <span class="s s16">Some wisdom has nothing to do with
people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain
structures are less prone to failure than others.</span> <span class="s s17">And certainly
smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well
as abstract ones.</span> 
<span class="s s18">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience
while intelligence is innate.</span> <span class="s s20">But people are not simply wise in
proportion to how much experience they have.</span> <span class="s s21">Other things must
contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a
reflective disposition, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between
wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.</span> <span class="s s23">So what is the
difference?</span> <span class="s s24">If we look at how people use the words "wise" and
"smart," what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Curve</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">"Wise" and "smart" are both ways of saying someone knows what to
do.</span> <span class="s s27">The difference is that "wise" means one has a high average
outcome across all situations, and "smart" means one does spectacularly
well in a few.</span> <span class="s s28">That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis
represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the
wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person
would have high peaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent
at its best and character at its worst.</span> <span class="s s30">Except you judge intelligence
at its best, and wisdom by its average.</span> <span class="s s31">That's how the two are
related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve
can be high.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart
person knows what to do in situations where few others could.</span> <span class="s s33">We
need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where
someone knows what to do because they have inside information.</span> 
<span class="s s34">[3]
But aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific
without starting to be mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">Nor do we need to.</span> <span class="s s36">Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or
at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the
distinction between wisdom and intelligence.</span> <span class="s s37">Human problems are
the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in
achieving a high average outcome.</span> <span class="s s38">And it seems natural that a
high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic
peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate
qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be
an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept:
there's no such thing.</span> <span class="s s40">"Wise" means something&mdash;that one is
on average good at making the right choice.</span> <span class="s s41">But giving the name
"wisdom" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't
mean such a thing exists.</span> <span class="s s42">To the extent "wisdom" means anything,
it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline,
experience, and empathy.</span> 
<span class="s s43">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">Likewise, though "intelligent" means something, we're asking for
trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called "intelligence.</span><span class="s s45">"</span>
<span class="s s46">And whatever its components, they're not all innate.</span> <span class="s s47">We use the
word "intelligent" as an indication of ability: a smart person can
grasp things few others could.</span> <span class="s s48">It does seem likely there's some
inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this
predisposition is not itself intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people
trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that
are most measurable.</span> <span class="s s50">A quality that's inborn will obviously be
more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience,
and thus might vary in the course of a study.</span> <span class="s s51">The problem comes
when we drag the word "intelligence" over onto what they're measuring.</span>
<span class="s s52">If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring
intelligence.</span> <span class="s s53">Three year olds aren't smart.</span> <span class="s s54">When we describe one
as smart, it's shorthand for "smarter than other three year olds.</span><span class="s s55">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">Split</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">Perhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to
intelligence is not the same as intelligence.</span> <span class="s s58">But it's an important
technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter,
just as we can become wiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same
curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve
decreases.</span> <span class="s s61">If there's just one point, they're identical: the average
and maximum are the same.</span> <span class="s s62">But as the number of points increases,
wisdom and intelligence diverge.</span> <span class="s s63">And historically the number of
points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is
tested in an ever wider range of situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded
wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we
do.</span> <span class="s s65">Distinguishing between "wise" and "smart" is a modern habit.</span>
<span class="s s66">[5]
And the reason we do is that they've been diverging.</span> <span class="s s67">As knowledge
gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the
distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper,
like a digital image rendered with more pixels.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.</span>
<span class="s s69">At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were
really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.</span> <span class="s s70">But the really striking
change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have
to decide which we prefer.</span> <span class="s s71">We may not be able to optimize for both
simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">Society seems to have voted for intelligence.</span> <span class="s s73">We no longer admire
the sage&mdash;not the way people did two thousand years ago.</span> <span class="s s74">Now
we admire the genius.</span> <span class="s s75">Because in fact the distinction we began
with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without
being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.</span> <span class="s s76">That
doesn't sound especially admirable.</span> <span class="s s77">That gets you James Bond, who
knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for
the ones involving math.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s78">Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.</span> <span class="s s79">In
fact, a high average may help support high peaks.</span> <span class="s s80">But there are
reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between
them.</span> <span class="s s81">One is the example of very smart people, who are so often
unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the
rule rather than the exception.</span> <span class="s s82">Perhaps the absent-minded professor
is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in
the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be.</span> 
<span class="s s83">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">New</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">For both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were
necessarily related.</span> <span class="s s86">The wise man was someone who knew what the
right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had
to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd
done the best he could.</span> <span class="s s87">I can't think of many ancient philosophers
who would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad," said Confucius.
[7]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician
who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he
hadn't made enough progress.</span> 
<span class="s s90">[8]
The Chinese and Greek words we
translate as "happy" didn't mean exactly what we do by it, but
there's enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">Is the mathematician a small man because he's discontented? No;
he's just doing a kind of work that wasn't very common in Confucius's
day.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.</span> <span class="s s93">Time after time, something
that seemed a small and uninteresting area&mdash;experimental error,
even&mdash;turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in
it as all knowledge up to that point.</span> <span class="s s94">Several of the fractal buds
that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and
discovering new things.</span> <span class="s s95">Math, for example, used to be something a
handful of people did part-time.</span> <span class="s s96">Now it's the career of thousands.</span>
<span class="s s97">And in work that involves making new things, some old rules don't
apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">Recently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the
ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well
as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience,
and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could.</span> <span class="s s99">But
I don't have anything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay.</span>
<span class="s s100">Then I'm worried.</span> <span class="s s101">What if I run out of ideas?</span> <span class="s s102">And when I'm writing,
four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't
get enough done.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of
work.</span> <span class="s s104">When people come to you with a problem and you have to figure
out the right thing to do, you don't (usually) have to invent
anything.</span> <span class="s s105">You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which
is the prudent choice.</span> <span class="s s106">But prudence can't tell me what sentence
to write next.</span> <span class="s s107">The search space is too big.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work
be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.</span> <span class="s s109">Makers
depend on something more precarious: inspiration.</span> <span class="s s110">And like most
people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried,
not contented.</span> <span class="s s111">In that respect they're more like the small man of
Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from
starvation.</span> <span class="s s112">Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and
officials, they're at the mercy of their own imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">Limits</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">To me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented.</span>
<span class="s s115">The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of
years of momentum behind it.</span> <span class="s s116">If I was any good, why didn't I have
the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?</span> <span class="s s117">But that, I now
believe, is like a runner asking "If I'm such a good athlete, why
do I feel so tired?</span><span class="s s118">"</span> <span class="s s119">Good runners still get tired; they just get
tired at higher speeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s120">People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same
position as the runner.</span> <span class="s s121">There's no way for them to do the best
they can, because there's no limit to what they could do.</span> <span class="s s122">The
closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.</span> <span class="s s123">But
the better you do, the less this matters.</span> <span class="s s124">An undergrad who gets
something published feels like a star.</span> <span class="s s125">But for someone at the top
of the field, what's the test of doing well?</span> <span class="s s126">Runners can at least
compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you
win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you
think you could have run a bit faster.</span> <span class="s s127">But what is a novelist to
do?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are
presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives,
there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every
time.</span> <span class="s s129">In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of
this type.</span> <span class="s s130">The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth
mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but
neither was expected to invent anything.</span> <span class="s s131">In principle they could
have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his
neighbor.</span> <span class="s s132">But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't
expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score
goals.</span> 
<span class="s s133">[9]
In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision
in every situation, and if you made it you'd done your job perfectly,
just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is
considered to have played a perfect game.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">In this world, wisdom seemed paramount.</span> 
<span class="s s135">[10]
Even now, most people
do work in which problems are put before them and they have to
choose the best alternative.</span> <span class="s s136">But as knowledge has grown more
specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people
have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore
unbounded.</span> <span class="s s137">Intelligence has become increasingly important relative
to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s138">Recipes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom
is how different their recipes are.</span> <span class="s s140">Wisdom seems to come largely
from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from
cultivating them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a
remedial character.</span> <span class="s s142">To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the
debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving
only the important stuff.</span> <span class="s s143">Both self-control and experience have
this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own
nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively.</span>
<span class="s s144">That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it.</span> <span class="s s145">Much of
what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year
old.</span> <span class="s s146">The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old
it's mixed together with a lot of random junk.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s147">The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems.
You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through
exercise.</span> <span class="s s148">But there can't be too much compulsion here.</span> <span class="s s149">No amount
of discipline can replace genuine curiosity.</span> <span class="s s150">So cultivating
intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's
character&mdash;some tendency to be interested in certain types of
things&mdash;and nurturing it.</span> <span class="s s151">Instead of obliterating your
idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for
the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into
a tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s152">The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people
tend to be smart in distinctive ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom.</span> <span class="s s154">So perhaps one
reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence
using recipes for wisdom.</span> <span class="s s155">Most recipes for wisdom have an element
of subjection.</span> <span class="s s156">At the very least, you're supposed to do what the
teacher says.</span> <span class="s s157">The more extreme recipes aim to break down your
individuality the way basic training does.</span> <span class="s s158">But that's not the route
to intelligence.</span> <span class="s s159">Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may
actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly
high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep
working.</span> <span class="s s160">Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">(The reason it's hard to learn new skills late in life is not just
that one's brain is less malleable.</span> <span class="s s162">Another probably even worse
obstacle is that one has higher standards.</span><span class="s s163">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s164">I realize we're on dangerous ground here.</span> <span class="s s165">I'm not proposing the
primary goal of education should be to increase students' "self-esteem.</span><span class="s s166">"</span>
<span class="s s167">That just breeds laziness.</span> <span class="s s168">And in any case, it doesn't really fool
the kids, not the smart ones.</span> <span class="s s169">They can tell at a young age that a
contest where everyone wins is a fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s170">A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to
come up with things on their own, but you can't simply applaud
everything they produce.</span> <span class="s s171">You have to be a good audience: appreciative,
but not too easily impressed.</span> <span class="s s172">And that's a lot of work.</span> <span class="s s173">You have
to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages
to know when to be surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.</span> <span class="s s175">Traditionally
the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student's job is
not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.</span> <span class="s s176">(The
use of the term "recitation" for sections in some colleges is a
fossil of this.</span><span class="s s177">) The problem with these old traditions is that
they're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">Different</span></p>
<p><span class="s s179">I deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's
worth being wise.</span> <span class="s s180">But I think it's important to understand the
relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what
seems to be the growing gap between them.</span> <span class="s s181">That way we can avoid
applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant
for wisdom.</span> <span class="s s182">These two senses of "knowing what to do" are more
different than most people realize.</span> <span class="s s183">The path to wisdom is through
discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected
self-indulgence.</span> <span class="s s184">Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.</span>
<span class="s s185">And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time
leads to discontentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s186">That's particularly worth remembering.</span> <span class="s s187">A physicist friend recently
told me half his department was on Prozac.</span> <span class="s s188">Perhaps if we acknowledge
that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds
of work, we can mitigate its effects.</span> <span class="s s189">Perhaps we can box it up and
put it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together
with everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large
pool.</span> <span class="s s190">At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about
being discontented.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s191">If you feel exhausted, it's not necessarily because there's something
wrong with you. Maybe you're just running fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s193">[1]
Gauss was supposedly asked this when he was 10.</span> <span class="s s194">Instead of
laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students,
he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100
+ 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get
the answer, 5050.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s195">[2]
A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems,
and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.</span> <span class="s s196">But
while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom
and intelligence, it's not the distinction between them.</span> <span class="s s197">Wisdom
is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in
deciding what to do with the solutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">[3]
In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out
some knowledge.</span> <span class="s s199">People who know the combination of a safe will be
better at opening it than people who don't, but no one would say
that was a test of intelligence or wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s200">But knowledge overlaps with wisdom and probably also intelligence.</span>
<span class="s s201">A knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom.</span> <span class="s s202">So where
do we draw the line?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s203">Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point
has a sharp drop in utility.</span> <span class="s s204">For example, understanding French
will help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops
sharply as soon as no one else involved knows French.</span> <span class="s s205">Whereas the
value of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s206">The knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has
little relation to other knowledge.</span> <span class="s s207">This includes mere conventions,
like languages and safe combinations, and also what we'd call
"random" facts, like movie stars' birthdays, or how to distinguish
1956 from 1957 Studebakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s208">[4]
People seeking some single thing called "wisdom" have been
fooled by grammar.</span> <span class="s s209">Wisdom is just knowing the right thing to do,
and there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in
that.</span> <span class="s s210">Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an
empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might
come from going to drunken parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s211">Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred
mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes.</span> <span class="s s212">The mystery
comes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist.</span> <span class="s s213">And
the reason there have historically been so many different schools
of thought about how to achieve wisdom is that they've focused on
different components of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s214">When I use the word "wisdom" in this essay, I mean no more than
whatever collection of qualities helps people make the right choice
in a wide variety of situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s215">[5]
Even in English, our sense of the word "intelligence" is
surprisingly recent.</span> <span class="s s216">Predecessors like "understanding" seem to
have had a broader meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s217">[6]
There is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks
attributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions.</span>
<span class="s s218">I'm using these names as we use the name "Homer," to mean the
hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">[7]
Analects VII:36, Fung trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s220">Some translators use "calm" instead of "happy.</span><span class="s s221">"</span> <span class="s s222">One source of
difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different
idea of happiness from many older societies.</span> <span class="s s223">Every language probably
has a word meaning "how one feels when things are going well," but
different cultures react differently when things go well.</span> <span class="s s224">We react
like children, with smiles and laughter.</span> <span class="s s225">But in a more reserved
society, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a
quiet contentment.</span></p>

It may have been Andrew Wiles, but I'm not sure. If anyone
remembers such an interview, I'd appreciate hearing from you.</span></p>

Confucius claimed proudly that he had never invented
anything&mdash;that he had simply passed on an accurate account of

philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as
teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about
such matters.</span> <span class="s s231">The few people who did invent things, like storytellers,
