  <h2><span class="s s1">How to Present to Investors</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.</span> <span class="s s4">Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.</span> <span class="s s5">Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Ten weeks is not much time.</span> <span class="s s7">The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.</span> <span class="s s8">But the average
startup fails.</span> <span class="s s9">When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work.</span> <span class="s s10">Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">(Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,
so we don't give them much money either.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day.</span>
<span class="s s13">At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not at
Rehearsal Day.</span> <span class="s s14">No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough.</span> <span class="s s16">But this is
to be expected.</span> <span class="s s17">We try to pick founders who are good at building
things, not ones who are slick presenters.</span> <span class="s s18">Some of the founders
are just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spoken
to a group of people they didn't already know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">So we concentrate on the basics.</span> <span class="s s20">On Demo Day each startup will
only get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two
goals: (a) explain what you're doing, and (b) explain why users
will want it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">That might sound easy, but it's not when the speakers have no
experience presenting, and they're explaining technical matters to
an audience that's mostly non-technical.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to
investors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people who
are bad at understanding.</span> <span class="s s23">Practically every successful startup,
including stars like Google, presented at some point to investors
who didn't get it and turned them down.</span> <span class="s s24">Was it because the founders
were bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse?</span> <span class="s s25">It's
probably always some of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners found
ourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two.</span>
<span class="s s27">So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting
to investors.</span> <span class="s s28">Most startups face similar challenges, so we hope
these will be useful to a wider audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">1. Explain what you're doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">Investors' main question when judging a very early startup is whether
you've made a compelling product.</span> <span class="s s31">Before they can judge whether
you've built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you've
built.</span> <span class="s s32">They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them
what you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">Say what you're doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first
sentence.</span> <span class="s s34">"We're Jeff and Bob and we've built an easy to use web-based
database.</span> <span class="s s35">Now we'll show it to you and explain why people need
this.</span><span class="s s36">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">If you're a great public speaker you may be able to violate this
rule.</span> <span class="s s38">Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk
on a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop
metaphor.</span> <span class="s s39">He got away with it, but unless you're a captivating
speaker, which most hackers aren't, it's better to play it safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">2. Get rapidly to demo.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting
at Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short
that they rarely include much if any demo.</span> <span class="s s42">They seem to work
just as well without, however, which makes me think I was
wrong to emphasize demos so much before.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal
description.</span> <span class="s s44">The only thing worth talking about first is the problem
you're trying to solve and why it's important.</span> <span class="s s45">But don't spend
more than a tenth of your time on that.</span> <span class="s s46">Then demo.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">When you demo, don't run through a catalog of features.</span> <span class="s s48">Instead
start with the problem you're solving, and then show how your product
solves it.</span> <span class="s s49">Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose,
rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">If you're demoing something web-based, assume that the network
connection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation,
and come prepared with a copy of the server software running on
your laptop.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">3. Better a narrow description than a vague one.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is
that, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities.</span>
<span class="s s53">The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow.</span> <span class="s s54">So for
example a group that has built an easy web-based database might
resist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so much
more.</span> <span class="s s55">In fact, it could be anything.</span><span class="s s56">.</span><span class="s s57">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description
of something that could be anything, the content of your description
approaches zero.</span> <span class="s s59">If you describe your web-based database as "a
system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of
information," it will go in one investor ear and out the other.</span>
<span class="s s60">They'll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, and
hope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you'll
actually explain what you've made.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might
one day become, but simply to convince investors you're worth talking
to further.</span> <span class="s s62">So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right
answer by successive approximations.</span> <span class="s s63">Begin with a description
that's gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to the
extent you can.</span> <span class="s s64">It's the same principle as incremental development:
start with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every point
have working code.</span> <span class="s s65">In this case, "working code" means a working
description in the investor's head.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">4. Don't talk and drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">Have one person talk while another uses the computer.</span> <span class="s s68">If the same
person does both, they'll inevitably mumble downwards at the computer
screen instead of talking clearly at the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">As long as you're standing near the audience and looking at them,
politeness (and habit) compel them to pay attention to you.</span> <span class="s s70">Once
you stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer,
their minds drift off to the errands they have to run later.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">5. Don't talk about secondary matters at length.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">If you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what your
product does and why it's great.</span> <span class="s s73">Second order issues like competitors
or resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at the
end.</span> <span class="s s74">If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screen
for 15 seconds and say a few words.</span> <span class="s s75">For competitors, list the top
3 and explain in one sentence each what they lack
that you have.</span> <span class="s s76">And put this kind of thing at the end, after you've
made it clear what you've built.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">6. Don't get too deeply into business models.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s78">It's good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly
because it shows you care about that and have thought about it.</span>
<span class="s s79">Don't go into detail about your business model, because (a) that's
not what smart investors care about in a brief presentation, and
(b) any business model you have at this point is probably wrong
anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about a
company he just invested in.</span> <span class="s s81">He said their business model was wrong
and would probably change three times before they got it right.</span>
<span class="s s82">The founders were experienced guys who'd done startups before and
who'd just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VC
firms, and even their business model was crap.</span> <span class="s s83">(And yet he invested
anyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.</span><span class="s s84">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">If you're solving an important problem, you're going to sound a lot
smarter talking about that than the business model.</span> <span class="s s86">The business
model is just a bunch of guesses, and guesses about stuff that's
probably not your area of expertise.</span> <span class="s s87">So don't spend your precious
few minutes talking about crap when you could be talking about
solid, interesting things you know a lot about: the problem you're
solving and what you've built so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">As well as being a bad use of time, if your business model seems
spectacularly wrong, that will push the stuff you want investors
to remember out of their heads.</span> <span class="s s89">They'll just remember you as the
company with the boneheaded plan for making money, rather than the
company that solved that important problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">7. Talk slowly and clearly at the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the people
who'd been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups,
and those who hadn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking to
a roomful of people than you would in conversation.</span> <span class="s s93">Everyday life
gives you no practice in this.</span> <span class="s s94">If you can't already do it, the
best solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick,
like juggling.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">However, that doesn't mean you should talk like some kind of
announcer.</span> <span class="s s96">Audiences tune that out.</span> <span class="s s97">What you need to do is talk
in this artificial way, and yet make it seem conversational.</span> <span class="s s98">(Writing
is the same.</span> <span class="s s99">Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.</span><span class="s s100">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s101">If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand and
memorize it, that's ok.</span> <span class="s s102">That has worked for some groups in the
past.</span> <span class="s s103">But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous,
informal speech, and deliver it that way too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s104">Err on the side of speaking slowly.</span> <span class="s s105">At Rehearsal Day, one of the founders
mentioned a rule actors use: if you feel you're speaking too slowly,
you're speaking at about the right speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">8. Have one person talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s107">Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners.</span>
<span class="s s108">This is a good instinct; investors dislike unbalanced teams. But
trying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going too
far.</span> <span class="s s109">It's distracting.</span> <span class="s s110">You can demonstrate your respect
for one another in more subtle ways.</span> <span class="s s111">For example, when one of the
groups presented at Demo Day, the more extroverted of the two
founders did most of the talking, but he described his co-founder
as the best hacker he'd ever met, and you could tell he meant it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">Pick the one or at most two best speakers, and have them do most
of the talking.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">Exception: If one of the founders is an expert in some specific
technical field, it can be good for them to talk about that for a
minute or so.</span> <span class="s s114">This kind of "expert witness" can add credibility,
even if the audience doesn't understand all the details.</span> <span class="s s115">If Jobs
and Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II, it might be a good plan
to have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minute
in the middle about some of the technical feats he'd pulled off in
the design.</span> <span class="s s116">(Though of course if it were actually those two, Jobs
would speak for the entire 10 minutes.</span><span class="s s117">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">9. Seem confident.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">Between the brief time available and their lack of technical
background, many in the audience will have a hard time evaluating
what you're doing.</span> <span class="s s120">Probably the single biggest piece of evidence,
initially, will be your own confidence in it.</span> <span class="s s121">You have
to show you're impressed with what you've made.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">And I mean show, not tell.</span> <span class="s s123">Never say "we're passionate" or "our
product is great.</span><span class="s s124">"</span> <span class="s s125">People just ignore that&mdash;or worse, write you
off as bullshitters.</span> <span class="s s126">Such messages must be implicit.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s127">What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic.</span> <span class="s s128">If you've
truly made something good, you're doing investors a favor by
telling them about it.</span> <span class="s s129">If you don't genuinely believe that, perhaps
you ought to change what your company is doing.</span> <span class="s s130">If you don't believe
your startup has such promise that you'd be doing them a favor by
letting them invest, why are you investing your time in it?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s131">10. Don't try to seem more than you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">Don't worry if your company is just a few months old and doesn't
have an office yet, or your founders are technical people with no
business experience.</span> <span class="s s133">Google was like that once, and they turned out
ok.</span> <span class="s s134">Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws.</span> <span class="s s135">They're
not looking for finished, smooth presentations.</span> <span class="s s136">They're looking
for raw talent.</span> <span class="s s137">All you need to convince them of is that you're
smart and that you're onto something good.</span> <span class="s s138">If you try too hard to
conceal your rawness&mdash;by trying to seem corporate, or pretending
to know about stuff you don't&mdash;you may just conceal your talent.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s139">You can afford to be candid about what you haven't figured out yet.</span>
<span class="s s140">Don't go out of your way to bring it up (e.</span><span class="s s141">g.</span> <span class="s s142">by having a slide
about what might go wrong), but don't try to pretend either that
you're further along than you are.</span> <span class="s s143">If you're a hacker and you're
presenting to experienced investors, they're probably better at
detecting bullshit than you are at producing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">11. Don't put too many words on slides.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">When there are a lot of words on a slide, people just skip reading
it.</span> <span class="s s146">So look at your slides and ask of each word "could I cross
this out?</span><span class="s s147">"</span> <span class="s s148">This includes gratuitous clip art.</span> <span class="s s149">Try to get your
slides under 20 words if you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s150">Don't read your slides.</span> <span class="s s151">They should be something in the background
as you face the audience and talk to them, not something you face
and read to an audience sitting behind you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s152">Cluttered sites don't do well in demos, especially when they're
projected onto a screen.</span> <span class="s s153">At the very least, crank up the font size
big enough to make all the text legible.</span> <span class="s s154">But cluttered sites are
bad anyway, so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make your
design simpler.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s155">12. Specific numbers are good.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s156">If you have any kind of data, however preliminary, tell the audience.</span>
<span class="s s157">Numbers stick in people's heads.</span> <span class="s s158">If you can claim that the median
visitor generates 12 page views, that's great.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s159">But don't give them more than four or five numbers, and only give
them numbers specific to you.</span> <span class="s s160">You don't need to tell them the size
of the market you're in.</span> <span class="s s161">Who cares, really, if it's 500 million
or 5 billion a year?</span> <span class="s s162">Talking about that is like an actor at the
beginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanks
makes.</span> <span class="s s163">Yeah, sure, but first you have to become Tom Hanks.</span> <span class="s s164">The
important part is not whether he makes ten million a year or a
hundred, but how you get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s165">13. Tell stories about users.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s166">The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups is
that you've built something based on your own a priori theories of
what the world needs, but that no one will actually want.</span> <span class="s s167">So it's
good if you can talk about problems specific users have and how you
solve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s168">Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the "proxy for
demand.</span><span class="s s169">"</span> <span class="s s170">What are people doing now, using inadequate tools, that
shows they need what you're making?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s171">Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something.</span>
<span class="s s172">It's easy to convince investors there will be demand for
a cheaper alternative to something popular, if you preserve
the qualities that made it popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s173">The best stories about user needs are about your own.</span> <span class="s s174">A remarkable
number of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had:
Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google.</span> <span class="s s175">Experienced investors know that,
so stories of this type will get their attention.</span> <span class="s s176">The next best
thing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally,
like your friends or siblings.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s177">14. Make a soundbite stick in their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">Professional investors hear a lot of pitches.</span> <span class="s s179">After a while they
all blur together.</span> <span class="s s180">The first cut is simply to be one of those
they remember.</span> <span class="s s181">And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptive
phrase about yourself that sticks in their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">In Hollywood, these phrases seem to be of the form "x meets y.</span><span class="s s183">"</span>

<span class="s s184">In the startup world, they're usually "the x of y" or "the x y.</span><span class="s s185">"</span>
<span class="s s186">Viaweb's was "the Microsoft Word of ecommerce.</span><span class="s s187">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s188">Find one and launch it clearly (but apparently casually) in your
talk, preferably near the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">It's a good exercise for you, too, to sit down and try to figure
out how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase.</span> <span class="s s190">If you
can't, your plans may not be sufficiently focused.</span></p>
