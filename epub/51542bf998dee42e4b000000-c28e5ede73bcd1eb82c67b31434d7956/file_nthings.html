<p><span class="s s2">September 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">I bet you the current issue of Cosmopolitan has an article
whose title begins with a number.</span> <span class="s s4">"7 Things He Won't Tell You about
Sex," or something like that.</span> <span class="s s5">Some popular magazines
feature articles of this type on the cover of every
issue.</span> <span class="s s6">That can't be happening by accident.</span> <span class="s s7">Editors must know
they attract readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">Why do readers like the list of n things so much?</span> <span class="s s9">Mainly because
it's easier to read than a regular article.</span> 
<span class="s s10">[1]
Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay.</span>
<span class="s s11">An essay can go anywhere the writer wants.</span> <span class="s s12">In a list of n things
the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points
of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly
what they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its
structure&mdash;figuring out what in high school we'd have called
its "outline.</span><span class="s s14">"</span> <span class="s s15">Not explicitly, of course, but someone who really
understands an article probably has something in his brain afterward
that corresponds to such an outline.</span> <span class="s s16">In a list of n things, this
work is done for you.</span> <span class="s s17">Its structure is an exoskeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the
simplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate
ones, and no particular connection between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is
random access.</span> <span class="s s20">There's no thread of reasoning you have to follow.</span> <span class="s s21">You could
read the list in any order.</span> <span class="s s22">And because the points are independent
of one another, they work like watertight compartments in an
unsinkable ship.</span> <span class="s s23">If you get bored with, or can't understand, or
don't agree with one point, you don't have to give up on the article.</span>
<span class="s s24">You can just abandon that one and skip to the next.</span> <span class="s s25">A list of n
things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">There are times when this format is what a writer wants.</span> <span class="s s27">One, obviously,
is when what you have to say actually is a list of n
things.</span> <span class="s s28">I once wrote an essay about the mistakes that kill startups, and a few people made fun of me
for writing something whose title began with a number.</span> <span class="s s29">But in that
case I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of
independent things.</span> <span class="s s30">In fact, one of the questions I was trying to
answer was how many there were.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format.</span> <span class="s s32">For
example, I use it when I get close to a deadline.</span> <span class="s s33">If I have to
give a talk and I haven't started it a few days beforehand, I'll
sometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers.</span> <span class="s s35">When
you're writing a real essay, there's always a chance you'll hit a
dead end.</span> <span class="s s36">A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of
thought just peter out.</span> <span class="s s37">That's an alarming possibility when you
have to give a talk in a few days.</span> <span class="s s38">What if you run out of ideas?</span>
<span class="s s39">The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects
the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects
the reader.</span> <span class="s s40">If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it
won't kill the essay.</span> <span class="s s41">You can take out the whole point if you need
to, and the essay will still survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">Writing a list of n things is so relaxing.</span> <span class="s s43">You think of n/2 of
them in the first 5 minutes.</span> <span class="s s44">So bang, there's the structure, and
you just have to fill it in.</span> <span class="s s45">As you think of more points, you just
add them to the end.</span> <span class="s s46">Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a
few, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res)
list of n things.</span> <span class="s s47">It's like the sort of programming where you write
a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every
point have working code&mdash;or the style of painting where you begin
with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend
a week cranking up the resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s48">Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it's not
always a damning sign when readers prefer it.</span> <span class="s s49">It's not necessarily
evidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don't have
much confidence in the writer.</span> <span class="s s50">The list of n things is in that
respect the cheeseburger of essay forms. If you're eating at a
restaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order the
cheeseburger.</span> <span class="s s51">Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger.</span> <span class="s s52">And
there are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should
look like.</span> <span class="s s53">You can assume the cook isn't going to try something
weird and artistic.</span> <span class="s s54">The list of n things similarly limits the
damage that can be done by a bad writer.</span> <span class="s s55">You know it's going to
be about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writer
from indulging in any flights of fancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should
be a good one for beginning writers.</span> <span class="s s57">And in fact it is what most
beginning writers are taught.</span> <span class="s s58">The classic 5 paragraph essay is
really a list of n things for n = 3.</span> <span class="s s59">But the students writing them
don't realize they're using the same structure as the articles they
read in Cosmopolitan.</span> <span class="s s60">They're not allowed to include the numbers,
and they're expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous
transitions ("Furthermore.</span><span class="s s61">.</span><span class="s s62">.</span><span class="s s63">"</span><span class="s s64">) and cap the thing at either end with
introductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially
like a real essay.</span>
<span class="s s65">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things.</span>
<span class="s s67">It's the easiest form.</span> <span class="s s68">But if we're going to do that, why not do
it openly?</span> <span class="s s69">Let them write lists of n things like the pros, with
numbers and no transitions or "conclusion.</span><span class="s s70">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format:
when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list
is an exhaustive one.</span> <span class="s s72">I.</span><span class="s s73">e.</span> <span class="s s74">if you write an article that purports
to be about the 7 secrets of success.</span> <span class="s s75">That kind of title is the
same sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit.</span> <span class="s s76">You have to at least
look at the article to check whether they're the same 7 you'd list.</span>
<span class="s s77">Are you overlooking one of the secrets of success?</span> <span class="s s78">Better check.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">It's fine to put "The" before the number if you really believe
you've made an exhaustive list.</span> <span class="s s80">But evidence suggests most things
with titles like this are linkbait.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there's so
little room for new thought.</span> <span class="s s82">The main point of essay writing, when
done right, is the new ideas you have while doing it.</span> <span class="s s83">A real essay,
as the name implies, is 
dynamic: you don't know what you're going
to write when you start.</span> <span class="s s84">It will be about whatever you discover
in the course of writing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things.</span>
<span class="s s86">You make the title first, and that's what it's going to be about.</span>
<span class="s s87">You can't have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the
watertight compartments you set up initially.</span> <span class="s s88">And your brain seems
to know this: because you don't have room for new ideas, you don't
have them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5
paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn
them about this.</span> <span class="s s90">It only lets you experience the defining
characteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of a
sentence or two.</span> <span class="s s91">And it's particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph
essay buries the list of n things within something that looks like
a more sophisticated type of essay.</span> <span class="s s92">If you don't know you're using
this form, you don't know you need to escape it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">[1]
Articles of this type are also startlingly popular on Delicious,
but I think that's because 
delicious/popular 
is driven by bookmarking,
not because Delicious users are stupid.</span> <span class="s s95">Delicious users are
collectors, and a list of n things seems particularly collectible
because it's a collection itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">[2]
Most "word problems" in school math textbooks are similarly
misleading.</span> <span class="s s97">They look superficially like the application of math
to real problems, but they're not.</span> <span class="s s98">So if anything they reinforce
the impression that math is merely a complicated but pointless
collection of stuff to be memorized.</span></p>
