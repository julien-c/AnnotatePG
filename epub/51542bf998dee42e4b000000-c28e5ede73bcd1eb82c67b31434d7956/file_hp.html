  <h2><span class="s s1">Hackers and Painters</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">May 2003</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a guest lecture at Harvard, which incorporated
an earlier talk at Northeastern.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">When I finished grad school in computer science I went
to art school to study painting.</span> <span class="s s5">A lot of people seemed surprised
that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting.</span>
<span class="s s6">They seemed to think that
hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that
hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that
painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">Both of these images are wrong.</span> <span class="s s8">Hacking and painting have a
lot in common.</span> <span class="s s9">In fact, of all the different types of people I've
known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">What hackers and painters have in common is that they're
both makers.</span> <span class="s s11">Along with composers, architects, and writers,
what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.</span>
<span class="s s12">They're not doing research per se, though if in the course of
trying to make good things they discover some new technique,
so much the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">I've never liked the term "computer science.</span><span class="s s14">"</span> <span class="s s15">The main
reason I don't like it is that there's no such thing.</span>
<span class="s s16">Computer science is a
grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together
by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia.</span>
<span class="s s17">At one end you have people who are really mathematicians,
but call what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants.</span>
<span class="s s18">In the middle you have people working on
something like the natural history of computers-- studying the
behavior of algorithms for routing data through
networks, for example.</span> <span class="s s19">And then at the other extreme you
have the hackers, who are trying to
write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a
medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or
paint for painters.</span> <span class="s s20">It's as if
mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in
the same department.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">Sometimes what the hackers do is called "software engineering,"
but this term is just as misleading.</span>
<span class="s s22">Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are.</span>
<span class="s s23">The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply
defined, but it's there.</span>
<span class="s s24">It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do,
and engineers figure out how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">What and how should not be kept too separate.</span> <span class="s s26">You're
asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without
understanding how to do it.</span>
<span class="s s27">But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to
implement some spec.</span> <span class="s s28">At its best, it's creating the spec-- though
it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">Perhaps one day
"computer science" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its
component parts.</span> <span class="s s30">That might be a good thing.</span> <span class="s s31">Especially if it
meant independence for my native land, hacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Bundling all these different types of work together in one
department may be convenient administratively, but it's confusing
intellectually.</span> <span class="s s33">That's the other reason I don't like the name
"computer science.</span><span class="s s34">"</span> <span class="s s35">Arguably the people in the middle are doing
something like an experimental science.</span> <span class="s s36">But the people at either
end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">The mathematicians don't seem bothered by this.</span> <span class="s s38">They happily
set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians
over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing
that the building they work in says ``computer science'' on the
outside.</span> <span class="s s39">But for the hackers this label is a problem.</span>
<span class="s s40">If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they
ought to be acting scientific.</span>
<span class="s s41">So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is 
to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and
research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">In the best case, the papers are just a formality.</span> <span class="s s43">Hackers write
cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper
becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software.</span>
<span class="s s44">But often this mismatch causes problems. It's easy to
drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly
things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">Unfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the
best subjects for papers.</span>
<span class="s s46">Number one, research must be original-- and
as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to
be sure that you're exploring virgin territory is to to stake
out a piece of ground that no one wants.</span> <span class="s s47">Number two, research must be
substantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers,
because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome
in order to get things done.</span> <span class="s s48">Nothing yields meaty problems like
starting with the wrong assumptions.</span> <span class="s s49">Most of AI is an example
of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented
as a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent
abstract concepts, you'll have a lot of
papers to write about how to make this work.</span> <span class="s s50">As Ricky Ricardo
used to say, "Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do.</span><span class="s s51">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle
tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing
ideas in a slightly new way.</span> <span class="s s53">This kind of work is hard to
convey in a research paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">So why do universities and research labs continue to judge
hackers by publications?</span>
<span class="s s55">For the same reason that "scholastic aptitude"
gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or
the productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code.</span>
<span class="s s56">These tests
are easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy test
that kind of works.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing
beautiful software, would be much more difficult.</span> <span class="s s58">You need
a good sense of design to judge 
good design.</span> <span class="s s59">And
there is no correlation, except possibly
a negative 
one, between people's ability to recognize good
design and their confidence that they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">The only external test is time.</span> <span class="s s61">Over time, beautiful
things tend to thrive, and ugly
things tend to get discarded.</span> <span class="s s62">Unfortunately, the amounts of time
involved can be longer than human lifetimes.</span> <span class="s s63">Samuel Johnson
said it took a hundred years for a writer's reputation to
converge.</span> <span class="s s64">You have to wait for the writer's
influential friends to die, and then for all their followers
to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random
component in their reputations.</span> <span class="s s66">In this they are no different
from other makers.</span> <span class="s s67">In fact, they're lucky by comparison.</span> 
<span class="s s68">The influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as it
is in painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">There are worse things than having people misunderstand your
work.</span> <span class="s s70">A worse danger is that you
will yourself misunderstand your work.</span> <span class="s s71">Related fields are
where you go looking for ideas.</span> <span class="s s72">If you find yourself in the computer science
department, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example,
that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer
science is the theory of.</span> <span class="s s73">All
the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feeling
in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory,
and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all that
stuff within three weeks of the final exam.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">Now I realize I was
mistaken.</span> <span class="s s75">Hackers need to understand the theory of computation
about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry.</span>
<span class="s s76">You need to know how to calculate time and
space complexity and about
Turing completeness.</span> <span class="s s77">You might also want to remember at
least the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write
a parser or a regular expression library.</span> <span class="s s78">Painters in fact 
have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than 
that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">I've found that the best sources of ideas
are not the other fields that have the word "computer" in
their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers.</span>
<span class="s s80">Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than the
theory of computation.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">For example, I was taught in college
that one ought to figure out a program
completely on paper
before even going near a computer.</span> <span class="s s82">I found that I did not
program this way.</span> <span class="s s83">I found that I liked to program
sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper.</span> <span class="s s84">Worse
still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program
and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew
out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into
shape.</span> <span class="s s85">Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where
you caught typos and oversights.</span> <span class="s s86">The way I worked, it
seemed like programming consisted of debugging.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s87">For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once
felt bad that I didn't hold my pencil the way they taught me
to in elementary school.</span>
<span class="s s88">If I had only looked over at
the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would
have realized that there was a name for what I was doing:
sketching.</span> <span class="s s89">As far as I can tell, the
way they taught me to program in college was all wrong.</span>
<span class="s s90">You should figure out programs as you're writing them,
just as writers and painters and architects do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">Realizing this has real implications for software design.</span>
<span class="s s92">It means that a programming language should, above all, be
malleable.</span> <span class="s s93">A programming language is for 
thinking of
programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought
of.</span> <span class="s s94">It should be a pencil, not a pen.</span> <span class="s s95">Static typing would
be a fine idea if people actually did write programs the way
they taught me to in college.</span> <span class="s s96">But that's not how any of the 
hackers I know write programs. We need a language that lets us
scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you have
to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make
polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">While we're on the subject of static typing, identifying with
the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts
the sciences: math envy.</span> <span class="s s98">Everyone in the sciences
secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are.</span> 
<span class="s s99">I think mathematicians also believe this.</span> <span class="s s100">At any rate,
the result is that scientists tend to make their
work look as mathematical as possible.</span> <span class="s s101">In a field like
physics this probably doesn't do much harm, but the further you
get from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it
becomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s102">A page of formulas just looks so impressive.</span>
<span class="s s103">(Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.</span><span class="s s104">) And
so there is a great temptation to work on problems you
can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say,
important.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s105">If hackers identified with other makers, like writers and
painters, they wouldn't feel tempted to do 
this.</span> <span class="s s106">Writers and painters don't suffer from math envy.</span>
<span class="s s107">They feel as if they're doing something completely unrelated.</span>
<span class="s s108">So are hackers, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">If universities and research labs keep hackers from doing
the kind of work they want to do,
perhaps the place for them is in companies.</span>
<span class="s s110">Unfortunately, most companies won't let hackers do what they
want either.</span> <span class="s s111">Universities and research labs force hackers
to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">I only discovered this myself quite recently.</span> <span class="s s113">When Yahoo bought
Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do.</span> <span class="s s114">I had never
liked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted to
hack.</span> <span class="s s115">When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant
to them was implementing software, not designing it.</span> <span class="s s116">Programmers
were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if
that is the word) of product managers into code.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">This seems to be the
default plan in big companies.</span> <span class="s s118">They do it because
it decreases the standard deviation of the outcome.</span>
<span class="s s119">Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software,
and it's hard for the
people running a company to pick these out.</span> <span class="s s120">So instead of
entrusting the future of the software to
one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is
designed by committee, and the hackers merely
implement the design.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s121">If you want to make money at some point, remember this,
because this is one of the reasons startups win.</span> <span class="s s122">Big companies want
to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they
want to avoid disasters.</span> <span class="s s123">But when you damp oscillations, you
lose the high points as well as the low.</span> <span class="s s124">This is not a problem for
big companies, because they don't win by making great
products.</span> <span class="s s125">Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s126">So if you can figure out a way to get in a
design war with a company big enough that its software is 
designed by product managers, they'll never be able to keep up
with you.</span> <span class="s s127">These opportunities are not easy to find, though.</span>
<span class="s s128">It's hard to engage a big company in a design war,
just as it's hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in hand
to hand combat.</span> <span class="s s129">It would be pretty easy to write a better
word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft,
within the castle of their operating system monopoly,
probably wouldn't even notice if you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s130">The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one
has yet managed to establish any fortifications.</span> <span class="s s131">That's where
you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and
having the same people both design and implement the product.</span> 
<span class="s s132">Microsoft themselves did this at the start.</span> <span class="s s133">So did Apple.</span>
<span class="s s134">And Hewlett-Packard.</span> <span class="s s135">I suspect almost every successful startup
has.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s136">So one way to build great software is to start your own
startup.</span> <span class="s s137">There are two problems with this, though.</span> <span class="s s138">One is
that in a startup you have to do so much besides write software.</span>
<span class="s s139">At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I
got to hack a quarter of the time.</span> <span class="s s140">And the things I had to 
do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tedious
to terrifying.</span> <span class="s s141">I have a benchmark for this, because I
once had to leave a board meeting to have
some cavities filled.</span> <span class="s s142">I remember sitting back in the
dentist's chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling like
I was on vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s143">The other problem with startups is that there is not much
overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the
kind that's interesting to write.</span> <span class="s s144">Programming languages
are interesting to write, and Microsoft's first product was
one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages
now.</span> <span class="s s145">If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work
on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s146">All makers face this problem.</span> <span class="s s147">Prices are
determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much
demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for
things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers.</span>
<span class="s s148">Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn't pay as well as
wearing a gorilla suit in someone's booth at a
trade show.</span> <span class="s s149">Writing novels doesn't pay as well as writing
ad copy for garbage disposals.</span>
<span class="s s150">And hacking programming languages doesn't pay as well
as figuring out how to connect some company's
legacy database to their Web server.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s151">I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software,
is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job.</span>
<span class="s s152">This phrase began with musicians, who
perform at night.</span> <span class="s s153">More generally, it means that you have one
kind of work you do for money, and another for love.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s154">Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers.</span>
<span class="s s155">Painters and writers notoriously do.</span> <span class="s s156">If you're lucky
you can get a day job that's closely
related to your real work.</span> <span class="s s157">Musicians often
seem to work in record stores.</span> <span class="s s158">A hacker working on some
programming language or operating system might likewise be able to
get a day job using it.</span> <span class="s s159">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s160">When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, 
and work on beautiful software on the side, I'm not proposing
this as a new idea.</span> <span class="s s161">This is what open-source hacking is all 
about.</span> <span class="s s162">What I'm saying is that open-source is probably the right
model, because it has been independently confirmed by all the 
other makers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s163">It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant
to let hackers work on open-source projects.</span>
<span class="s s164">At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone
who didn't.</span> <span class="s s165">When we interviewed
programmers, the main
thing we cared about was what kind of software they
wrote in their spare time.</span>
<span class="s s166">You can't do anything really well unless
you love it, and if you love to hack you'll inevitably
be working on projects of your own.</span> <span class="s s167">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s168">Because hackers are makers rather than scientists,
the right place to look for metaphors is not in the
sciences, but among other kinds of makers.</span> <span class="s s169">What else can painting
teach us about hacking?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s170">One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the
example of painting is how to learn to hack.</span> <span class="s s171">You learn to
paint mostly by doing it.</span>
<span class="s s172">Ditto for hacking.</span> <span class="s s173">Most hackers don't learn to hack by
taking college courses in programming.</span> <span class="s s174">They learn to hack
by writing programs of their own at age thirteen.</span> <span class="s s175">Even in 
college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking.</span> <span class="s s176">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s177">Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you
can watch them learn by doing.</span> <span class="s s178">If you look at the work
of a painter in chronological order, you'll find that each 
painting builds on things that have been learned in previous
ones.</span> <span class="s s179">When there's something in
a painting that works very well, you can usually find version 
1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">I think most makers work this way.</span> <span class="s s181">Writers and architects seem
to as well.</span> <span class="s s182">Maybe it would be good for hackers
to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch,
instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and
trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s183">The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another
sign of how different hacking is from the sciences.</span> <span class="s s184">Scientists
don't learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets.</span>
<span class="s s185">Scientists start out doing work that's perfect, in the sense
that they're just trying to reproduce work someone else has 
already done for them.</span>
<span class="s s186">Eventually, they get
to the point where they can do original work.</span>
<span class="s s187">Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's
just very bad.</span> <span class="s s188">So hackers start original, and get good, and
scientists start good, and get original.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">The other way makers learn is from examples.</span>
<span class="s s190">For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques.</span>
<span class="s s191">For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional
education of painters to copy the works of the great masters,
because copying forces you to look closely
at the way a painting is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">Writers do this too.</span>
<span class="s s193">Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points 
in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to
reproduce them.</span> <span class="s s194">Raymond Chandler did the same thing
with detective stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s195">Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at 
good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source
code too.</span> <span class="s s196">One of the less publicized benefits
of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier
to learn to program.</span> <span class="s s197">When I learned to program, we had to rely
mostly on examples in books.</span> <span class="s s198">The one big chunk of
code available then was Unix, but even this was not 
open source.</span> <span class="s s199">Most of the people who read the source
read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions' book, which
though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published
until 1996.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s200">Another example we can take from painting is the way that
paintings are created by gradual refinement.</span> <span class="s s201">Paintings usually
begin with a sketch.</span>
<span class="s s202">Gradually the details get filled in.</span>
<span class="s s203">But it is not merely a process of filling in.</span> <span class="s s204">Sometimes 
the original plans turn out to be mistaken.</span>
<span class="s s205">Countless paintings,
when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that
have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s206">Here's a case where we can learn from painting.</span> <span class="s s207">I think hacking
should work this way too.</span> <span class="s s208">It's unrealistic
to expect that the specifications for a program will be
perfect.</span> <span class="s s209">You're
better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in
a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s210">(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them
to do, so here is another place where startups have an advantage.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s211">Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature
optimization.</span> <span class="s s212">I think we should be just as worried about
premature design-- deciding too early what
a program should do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">The right tools can help us avoid
this danger.</span>
<span class="s s214">A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it
easy to change your mind.</span> <span class="s s215">Dynamic typing is a win here because
you don't have to
commit to specific data representations up front.</span>
<span class="s s216">But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language
very abstract.</span>
<span class="s s217">The easiest program to change is one that's very short.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">This sounds like a paradox, but a great painting
has to be better than it has to be.</span>
<span class="s s219">For example, when Leonardo
painted the portrait of Ginevra de Benci
in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head.</span>
<span class="s s220">In it he carefully
painted each individual leaf.</span> <span class="s s221">Many painters might have thought,
this is just something to put in the background to frame
her head.</span> <span class="s s222">No one will look that closely at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s223">Not Leonardo.</span> <span class="s s224">How hard he worked on part of a painting didn't
depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it.</span>
<span class="s s225">He was like Michael Jordan.</span> <span class="s s226">Relentless.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s227">Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details
become visible.</span>
<span class="s s228">When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci,
their attention is often immediately arrested by it,
even before they look at the label and notice that it says
Leonardo da Vinci.</span> <span class="s s229">All those unseen details combine to produce
something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible
voices all singing in tune.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s230">Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to
beauty.</span> <span class="s s231">If you look inside good software, you find that
parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too.</span>
<span class="s s232">I'm not claiming I write great software, but I
know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would
make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday
life the same way.</span>
<span class="s s233">It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented,
or that uses ugly variable names.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s234">If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then
he could just work his way through it from one end to the other like
someone digging a ditch.</span> <span class="s s235">But if the hacker is a creator, we have
to take inspiration into account.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s236">In hacking, like painting,
work comes in cycles.</span> <span class="s s237">Sometimes you get excited about some
new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it.</span> 
<span class="s s238">Other times nothing seems interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s239">To do good work you have to take these cycles into
account, because they're affected by how you react to them.</span>
<span class="s s240">When you're driving a
car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off
the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling.</span> <span class="s s241">Backing
off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling.</span>
<span class="s s242">In both painting and hacking there are some
tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are
comfortingly routine.</span> <span class="s s243">It's a good idea to save some easy
tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s244">In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs.</span>
<span class="s s245">I like debugging: it's the
one time that hacking is as straightforward as 
people think it is.</span> <span class="s s246">You have a
totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve
it.</span> <span class="s s247">Your program is supposed to do x.</span> <span class="s s248">Instead it does y.</span>
<span class="s s249">Where does it go wrong?</span> <span class="s s250">You know you're going to win
in the end.</span> <span class="s s251">It's as relaxing as painting a wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s252">The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our
own work, but how to work together.</span> <span class="s s253">A lot of the
great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though
there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the
museum.</span> <span class="s s254">Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of
Verrocchio and painted one of the angels in his Baptism of
Christ.</span> <span class="s s255">This sort of thing was the rule, not the exception.</span>
<span class="s s256">Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting
on painting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s257">As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting,
they never worked on the same parts.</span> <span class="s s258">It was common
for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants
to paint the others and the background.</span> <span class="s s259">But you never had
one guy painting over the work of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s260">I think this is the right model for collaboration in software
too.</span> <span class="s s261">Don't push it too far.</span> <span class="s s262">When a piece of code is
being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom
really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.</span> <span class="s s263">It will
tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.</span>
<span class="s s264">The right
way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply
defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces
between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible,
as articulated as programming languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s265">Like painting, most software is intended for
a human audience.</span> <span class="s s266">And so hackers, like painters, must have
empathy to do really great work.</span> <span class="s s267">You have to be able to see
things from the user's point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s268">When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from
someone else's point of view.</span> <span class="s s269">What this always meant in
practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what
I wanted.</span> <span class="s s270">This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a
point of not cultivating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s271">Boy, was I wrong.</span> <span class="s s272">It turns out that looking at things from 
other people's point of view is practically the secret of
success.</span> <span class="s s273">It doesn't necessarily mean being self-sacrificing.</span>
<span class="s s274">Far from it.</span> <span class="s s275">Understanding how someone else sees things
doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in some
situations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactly
the opposite.</span> <span class="s s276">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s277">Most makers make things for a human audience.</span>
<span class="s s278">And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need.</span>
<span class="s s279">Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people,
for example, because people are what people are interested in.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s280">Empathy is probably the single most important difference
between a good hacker and a great one.</span> <span class="s s281">Some hackers
are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are
practically solipsists.</span> <span class="s s282">It's hard for such 
people to design great software [5], because they can't
see things from the user's point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s283">One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch
them explain a technical question to someone without a technical
background.</span> <span class="s s284">We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart,
are just comically bad at this.</span> <span class="s s285">If someone asks them at
a dinner party what a programming language is, they'll
say something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what
the compiler uses as input to generate object code.</span><span class="s s286">'</span><span class="s s287">'
High-level language?</span> <span class="s s288">Compiler?</span> <span class="s s289">Object code?</span> <span class="s s290">Someone who 
doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't
know what these things are, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s291">Part of what software has to do is explain itself.</span> <span class="s s292">So to 
write good software you have to understand how little users 
understand.</span>
<span class="s s293">They're going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and
it had better do what they guess it will, because they're
not going to read the manual.</span> <span class="s s294">The best system I've ever seen 
in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985.</span>
<span class="s s295">It did what software almost never does: it just worked.</span> <span class="s s296">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s297">Source code, too, should explain itself.</span> <span class="s s298">If I could get people to
remember just one quote about programming, it would be the
one at the beginning of Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs.</span> 
</p><span class="s s299">&nbsp;
Programs should be written for people to read, and
only incidentally for machines to execute.
&nbsp;
You need to have 
empathy not just for your users, but for your readers. It's in 
your interest, because you'll be one of them.
Many a hacker has written a program only to
find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea 
how it works. I know several people who've sworn off Perl after
such experiences. [7]</span><p><span class="s s300">Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point
that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places.</span>
<span class="s s301">But I don't think there's any correlation.</span>
<span class="s s302">You can do well in math and
the natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in these
fields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to be
associated.</span> <span class="s s303">But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad at
empathy too.</span> <span class="s s304">Just listen to the people who call in with questions on
talk shows.</span> <span class="s s305">They ask whatever it is they're asking in
such a roundabout way
that the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s306">So, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool?</span>
<span class="s s307">After all, you only get one life.</span>
<span class="s s308">You might as well spend it working on something great.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s309">Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer.</span> <span class="s s310">There is always
a big time lag in prestige.</span> <span class="s s311">It's like light from a distant star.</span>
<span class="s s312">Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred
years ago.</span> <span class="s s313">At the time, no one thought
these paintings were as important as we do today.</span> <span class="s s314">It would have
seemed very odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro,
the Duke of Urbino, would one day be known mostly as the guy
with the strange nose in a painting 
by Piero della Francesca.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s315">So while I admit that hacking doesn't seem as cool as painting now,
we should remember that painting itself didn't seem as cool in
its glory days as it does now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s316">What we can say with some confidence is that these are the glory
days of hacking.</span> <span class="s s317">In most fields the great work is done early on.</span>
<span class="s s318">The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed.</span>
<span class="s s319">Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born,

and pushed the medium
so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow.</span>
<span class="s s320">Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen
with the novel.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s321">Over and over we see the same pattern.</span> <span class="s s322">A new medium appears, and
people are so excited about it that they explore most of its
possibilities in the first couple generations.</span> <span class="s s323">Hacking seems
to be in this phase now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s324">Painting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work
helped make it.</span>
<span class="s s325">How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can
do with this new medium.</span> 
</p>
<p><span class="s s327">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s328">[1] The greatest damage that photography has done
to painting may be the fact that it killed the best day job.</span>
<span class="s s329">Most of the great painters in history supported
themselves by painting portraits.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s331">[2] I've been told that Microsoft discourages
employees from contributing to open-source projects, even in
their spare time.</span>
<span class="s s332">But so many of the best hackers work on open-source
projects now that the main effect of this policy may be
to ensure that they won't be able to hire any first-rate
programmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s333">[3] What you learn about programming in college is much like
what you learn about books or clothes or dating: what bad taste you
had in high school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s334">[4] Here's an example of applied empathy.</span>
<span class="s s335">At Viaweb, if we couldn't decide between two alternatives, we'd
ask, what would our competitors hate most?</span> <span class="s s336">At one point a
competitor added a feature to their software that was basically
useless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn't, they
made much of it in the trade press.</span>
<span class="s s337">We could have tried to explain that the feature was useless,
but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we
just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own
version that afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s338">[5] Except text editors and compilers. Hackers don't need empathy to
design these, because they are themselves typical users.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s339">[6] Well, almost.</span> <span class="s s340">They overshot the available RAM somewhat,
causing much inconvenient disk swapping, but this could be fixed
within a few months by buying an additional disk drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s341">[7] The way to make programs easy to read is not to
stuff them with comments.</span> <span class="s s342">I would take Abelson and Sussman's
quote a step further.</span> <span class="s s343">Programming languages should be designed
to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell computers
how to execute them.</span> <span class="s s344">A good programming language
ought to be better for explaining software than English.</span>
<span class="s s345">You should only
need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn
readers about, just as on a road there are only
arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.</span>

Randall for reading drafts of this, and to Henry Leitner
