<p>
<span class="s s3">(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something
about the qualities we look for in founders.</span> <span class="s s4">In print they had to cut
the last item because they didn't have room.</span><span class="s s5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">1. Determination</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">This has turned out to be the most important quality in startup
founders.</span> <span class="s s8">We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most
important quality would be intelligence.</span> <span class="s s9">That's the myth in the
Valley.</span> <span class="s s10">And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.</span> <span class="s s11">But
as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what
matters most is determination.</span> <span class="s s12">You're going to hit a lot of
obstacles.</span> <span class="s s13">You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized
easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay 
are a good example.</span> <span class="s s15">They're
doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,
bureaucratic companies.</span> <span class="s s16">When you're starting a startup that depends
on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're
trying to ignore you out of existence.</span> <span class="s s17">But when Bill Clerico starts
calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not
going away.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">2. Flexibility</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">You do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases
like "don't give up on your dreams."</span> <span class="s s20">The world of startups is so
unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the
fly.</span> <span class="s s21">The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination
and flexibility you need is a running back.</span> 
<span class="s s22">He's determined to get
downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or
even backwards to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of
Greplin.</span> <span class="s s24">He applied to YC with 
some bad ecommerce idea.</span> <span class="s s25">We told
him we'd fund him if he did something else.</span> <span class="s s26">He thought for a second,
and said ok.</span> <span class="s s27">He then went through two more ideas before settling
on Greplin.</span> <span class="s s28">He'd only been working on it for a couple days when
he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.</span>
<span class="s s29">He always seems to land on his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">3. Imagination</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">Intelligence does matter a lot of course.</span> <span class="s s32">It seems like the type
that matters most is imagination.</span> <span class="s s33">It's not so important to be able
to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with
surprising new ideas.</span> <span class="s s34">In the startup world, most good ideas 
seem
bad initially.</span> <span class="s s35">If they were obviously good, someone would already
be doing them.</span> <span class="s s36">So you need the kind of intelligence that produces
ideas with just the right level of craziness.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Airbnb is that kind of idea.</span> 
<span class="s s38">In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we
thought it was too crazy.</span> <span class="s s39">We couldn't believe large numbers of
people would want to stay in other people's places.</span> <span class="s s40">We funded them
because we liked the founders so much.</span> <span class="s s41">As soon as we heard they'd
been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded
breakfast cereal, they were in.</span> <span class="s s42">And it turned out the idea was on
the right side of crazy after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">4. Naughtiness</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they
tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.</span> <span class="s s45">They're not Goody
Two-Shoes type good.</span> <span class="s s46">Morally, they care about getting the big
questions right, but not about observing proprieties.</span> <span class="s s47">That's why
I'd use the word naughty rather than evil.</span> <span class="s s48">They delight in 
breaking
rules, but not rules that matter.</span> <span class="s s49">This quality may be redundant
though; it may be implied by imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">Sam Altman of Loopt 
is one of the most successful alumni, so we
asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application
that would help us discover more people like him.</span> <span class="s s51">He said to ask
about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage&mdash;hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into
computers.</span> <span class="s s52">It has become one of the questions we pay most attention
to when judging applications.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">5. Friendship</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">Empirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just 
one
founder.</span> <span class="s s55">Most of the big successes have two or three.</span> <span class="s s56">And the
relationship between the founders has to be strong.</span> <span class="s s57">They must
genuinely like one another, and work well together.</span> <span class="s s58">Startups do
to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:
if it can be pulled apart, it will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of Justin.</span><span class="s s60">tv 
are a good example of close
friends who work well together.</span> <span class="s s61">They've known each other since
second grade.</span> <span class="s s62">They can practically read one another's minds.</span> <span class="s s63">I'm
sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed
any unresolved tension between them.</span></p>
