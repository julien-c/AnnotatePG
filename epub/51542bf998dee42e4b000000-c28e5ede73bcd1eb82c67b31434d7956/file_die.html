<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
August 2007</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This is a talk I gave at the last 
Y Combinator dinner of the summer.</span> 
<span class="s s4">Usually we don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of
a party.</span> <span class="s s5">But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could
save some of the startups from
preventable deaths.</span> <span class="s s6">So at the last minute I cooked up this rather
grim talk.</span> <span class="s s7">I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down
because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while
writing.</span><span class="s s8">)</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s9">A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third
of the companies we funded to succeed.</span> <span class="s s10">Actually I was being
conservative.</span> <span class="s s11">I'm hoping it might be as much as a half.</span> <span class="s s12">Wouldn't
it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.</span> <span class="s s14">Phrased
that way, it doesn't sound good at all.</span> <span class="s s15">In fact, it's kind of weird
when you think about it, because our definition of success is that
the founders get rich.</span> <span class="s s16">If half the startups we fund succeed, then
half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to
get nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.</span> <span class="s s18">That sounds like a joke,
but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a
typical startup.</span> <span class="s s19">It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb.</span>
<span class="s s20">We avoided dying till we got rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">It was really close, too.</span> <span class="s s22">When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about
being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of
their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to
back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.</span> <span class="s s23">So even
in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity
meeting preparation.</span> <span class="s s25">You've now done the preparation.</span> <span class="s s26">The work
you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get
lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die.</span> <span class="s s27">That's
more than most people have.</span> <span class="s s28">So let's talk about how not to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups
die.</span> <span class="s s30">About 10 of them so far.</span> <span class="s s31">We don't know exactly what happens
when they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically.</span>
<span class="s s32">Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear
from you.</span> <span class="s s34">When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a
couple months, that's a bad sign.</span> <span class="s s35">If we send them an email asking
what's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign.</span> <span class="s s36">So far
that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and
either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably
going to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s38">I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in
both directions.</span> <span class="s s39">Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing
from you, you won't die.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">That may not be so naive as it sounds.</span> <span class="s s41">You've probably noticed
that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders
causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every
dinner is a mini Demo Day.</span> <span class="s s42">Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.</span>
<span class="s s43">So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will
push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed
to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time
we talked.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">If this works, it would be an amazing hack.</span> <span class="s s45">It would be pretty
cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get
rich.</span> <span class="s s46">It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups.</span> <span class="s s48">There
is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco.</span> <span class="s s49">If you move
there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will
continue to operate.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">When startups die, the official cause of death is always either
running out of money or a critical founder bailing.</span> <span class="s s51">Often the two
occur simultaneously.</span> <span class="s s52">But I think the underlying cause is usually
that they've become demoralized.</span> <span class="s s53">You rarely hear of a startup
that's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new
features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP
unplugs their server.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging
on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup
can be demoralizing.</span> <span class="s s56">That is certainly true.</span> <span class="s s57">I've been there, and
that's why I've never done another startup.</span> <span class="s s58">The low points in a
startup are just unbelievably low.</span> <span class="s s59">I bet even Google had moments
where things seemed hopeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">Knowing that should help.</span> <span class="s s61">If you know it's going to feel terrible
sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think "ouch, this
feels terrible, I give up.</span><span class="s s62">"</span> <span class="s s63">It feels that way for everyone.</span> <span class="s s64">And
if you just hang on, things will probably get better.</span> <span class="s s65">The metaphor
people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller
coaster and not drowning.</span> <span class="s s66">You don't just sink and sink; there are
ups after the downs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a
startup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working.</span> <span class="s s68">The
reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably
won't work.</span> <span class="s s69">Startups almost never get it right the first time.</span>
<span class="s s70">Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares.</span> <span class="s s71">Don't
assume when this happens that you've failed.</span> <span class="s s72">That's normal for
startups.</span> <span class="s s73">But don't sit around doing nothing.</span> <span class="s s74">Iterate.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">I like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that
at least someone really loves.</span> <span class="s s76">As long as you've made something
that a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track.</span> <span class="s s77">It
will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who
really love you, and startups run on morale.</span> <span class="s s78">But also it
will tell you what to focus on.</span> <span class="s s79">What is it about you that they
love?</span> <span class="s s80">Can you do more of that?</span> <span class="s s81">Where can you find more people who
love that sort of thing?</span> <span class="s s82">As long as you have some core of users
who love you, all you have to do is expand it.</span> <span class="s s83">It may take a while,
but as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end.</span> <span class="s s84">Both
Blogger and Delicious did that.</span> <span class="s s85">Both took years to succeed.</span> <span class="s s86">But
both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan
and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally.</span> 
<span class="s s87">Wufoo is
on the same trajectory now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look
more closely.</span> <span class="s s89">Are there zero users who really love you, or is there
at least some little group that does?</span> <span class="s s90">It's quite possible there
will be zero.</span> <span class="s s91">In that case, tweak your product and try again.</span>
<span class="s s92">Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one
winning permutation somewhere in it.</span> <span class="s s93">If you just keep trying,
you'll find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">Let me mention some things not to do.</span> <span class="s s95">The number one thing not to
do is other things.</span> <span class="s s96">If you find yourself saying a sentence that
ends with "but we're going to keep working on the startup," you are
in big trouble.</span> <span class="s s97">Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to
keep working on the startup.</span> <span class="s s98">We're moving back to Minnesota, but
we're going to keep working on the startup.</span> <span class="s s99">We're taking on some
consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup.</span>
<span class="s s100">You may as well just translate these to "we're giving up on the
startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves," because
that's what it means most of the time.</span> <span class="s s101">A startup is so hard that
working on it can't be preceded by "but.</span><span class="s s102">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">In particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other
projects.</span> <span class="s s104">Distraction is fatal to startups.</span> <span class="s s105">Going to (or back to)
school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the
distraction it gives you something to say you're doing.</span> <span class="s s106">If you're
only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail.</span> <span class="s s107">If
you're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later "Oh
yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school,
but it didn't go anywhere.</span><span class="s s108">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">You can't use euphemisms like "didn't go anywhere" for something
that's your only occupation. People won't let you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">One of the most interesting things we've discovered from working
on Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of
looking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars.</span> <span class="s s111">So
if you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position
where failure will be public and humiliating.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">When we first met the founders of 
Octopart, they seemed very smart,
but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially
committed.</span> <span class="s s113">One of the two founders was still in grad school.</span> <span class="s s114">It
was the usual story: he'd drop out if it looked like the startup
was taking off.</span> <span class="s s115">Since then he has not only dropped out of grad
school, but appeared full length in 
Newsweek 
with the word "Billionaire"
printed across his chest.</span> <span class="s s116">He just cannot fail now.</span> <span class="s s117">Everyone he
knows has seen that picture.</span> <span class="s s118">Girls who dissed him in high school
have seen it.</span> <span class="s s119">His mom probably has it on the fridge.</span> <span class="s s120">It would be
unthinkably humiliating to fail now.</span> <span class="s s121">At this point he is committed
to fight to the death.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article
describing them as the next generation of billionaires, because
then none of them would be able to give up.</span> <span class="s s123">The success rate would
be 90%.</span> <span class="s s124">I'm not kidding.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery
guys.</span> <span class="s s126">Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined.</span> <span class="s s127">The
electronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep
their monopoly pricing.</span> <span class="s s128">(If it strikes you as odd that people still
order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there's
a reason for that.</span> <span class="s s129">The distributors want to prevent the transparency
that comes from having prices online.</span><span class="s s130">) I feel kind of bad that
we've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined.</span>
<span class="s s131">But that comes with the territory.</span> <span class="s s132">If a startup succeeds, you get
millions of dollars, and you don't get that kind of money just by
asking for it.</span> <span class="s s133">You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll
succeed.</span> <span class="s s135">They may have to morph themselves into something totally
different, but they won't just crawl off and die.</span> <span class="s s136">They're smart;
they're working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s137">All of you guys already have the first two.</span> <span class="s s138">You're all smart and
working on promising ideas.</span> <span class="s s139">Whether you end up among the living
or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s140">So I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming.</span> <span class="s s141">It always is in a startup.</span>
<span class="s s142">The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of
disaster happening are one in a thousand.</span> <span class="s s143">So don't get demoralized.</span>
<span class="s s144">When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what
Paul was talking about.</span> <span class="s s145">What did he say to do?</span> <span class="s s146">Oh, yeah.</span> <span class="s s147">Don't
give up.</span></p>
