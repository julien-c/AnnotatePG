  <h2><span class="s s1">What I've Learned from Hacker News</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">February 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Hacker News was two years
old last week.</span> <span class="s s4">Initially it was supposed to be a side project&mdash;an
application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future
Y Combinator founders to exchange news.</span> <span class="s s5">It's grown bigger and taken
up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've
learned so much from working on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Growth</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600
daily uniques.</span> <span class="s s8">It's since grown to around 22,000.</span> <span class="s s9">This growth
rate is a bit higher than I'd like.</span> <span class="s s10">I'd like the site to grow,
since a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead.</span>
<span class="s s11">But I wouldn't want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit&mdash;mainly
because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because
I don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">I already have problems enough with that.</span> <span class="s s13">Remember, the original
motivation for HN was to test a new programming language, and
moreover one that's focused on experimenting with language design,
not performance.</span> <span class="s s14">Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself
by recalling McIlroy and Bentley's famous quote</span>
</p><span class="s s15">&nbsp;
 The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special
 cases.
&nbsp;
and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code. So far
I've been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remained
consistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don't know what I'll
do next, but I'll probably think of something.</span><p><span class="s s16">This is my attitude to the site generally.</span> <span class="s s17">Hacker News is an
experiment, and an experiment in a very young field.</span> <span class="s s18">Sites of this
type are only a few years old.</span> <span class="s s19">Internet conversation generally is
only a few decades old.</span> <span class="s s20">So we've probably only discovered a fraction
of what we eventually will.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">That's why I'm so optimistic about HN.</span> <span class="s s22">When a technology is this
young, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means it
must be possible to do much better; which means many problems that
seem insoluble aren't.</span> <span class="s s23">Including, I hope, the problem that has
afflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Dilution</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Users have worried about that since the site was a few months old.</span>
<span class="s s26">So far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be.</span>
<span class="s s27">Dilution is a hard problem.</span> <span class="s s28">But probably soluble; it doesn't mean
much that open conversations have "always" been destroyed by growth
when "always" equals 20 instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">But it's important to remember we're trying to solve a new problem,
because that means we're going to have to try new things, most of
which probably won't work.</span> <span class="s s30">A couple weeks ago I tried displaying
the names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange.</span>
<span class="s s31">[1]
That was a mistake.</span> <span class="s s32">Suddenly a culture that had been more
or less united was divided into haves and have-nots.</span> <span class="s s33">I didn't
realize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided.</span> <span class="s s34">It
was painful to watch.</span>
<span class="s s35">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">So orange usernames won't be back.</span> <span class="s s37">(Sorry about that.</span><span class="s s38">) But there
will be other equally broken-seeming ideas in the future, and the
ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as broken as
those that don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">Probably the most important thing I've learned about dilution is
that it's measured more in behavior than users.</span> <span class="s s40">It's bad behavior
you want to keep out more than bad people.</span> <span class="s s41">User behavior turns out
to be surprisingly malleable.</span> <span class="s s42">If people are 
expected to behave
well, they tend to; and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad
people, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place where
they have to behave well.</span> <span class="s s44">But this way of keeping them out is
gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">It's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to
community sites as well.</span> <span class="s s46">The theory is that minor forms of bad
behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of
graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur.</span> <span class="s s47">I
was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that
made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was
miraculous.</span> <span class="s s48">And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened
there, and the transformation was equally dramatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">I'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis.</span> <span class="s s50">What happened to Reddit
didn't happen out of neglect.</span> <span class="s s51">From the start they had a policy of
censoring nothing except spam.</span> <span class="s s52">Plus Reddit had different goals
from Hacker News.</span> <span class="s s53">Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its
goal was to grow as fast as possible.</span> <span class="s s54">Combine rapid growth and
zero censorship, and the result is a free for all.</span> <span class="s s55">But I don't
think they'd do much differently if they were doing it again.</span>
<span class="s s56">Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker
News.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">But what happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN.</span> <span class="s s58">There
are several local maxima.</span> <span class="s s59">There can be places that are free for
alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the
real world; and people will behave differently depending on which
they're in, just as they do in the real world.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">I've observed this in the wild.</span> <span class="s s61">I've seen people cross-posting on
Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two
versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">Submissions</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs
to avoid: bad stories and bad comments.</span> <span class="s s64">So far the danger of bad
stories seems smaller.</span> <span class="s s65">The stories on the frontpage now are still
roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the
frontpage, but I haven't had to yet.</span> <span class="s s67">I wouldn't have predicted the
frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has.</span>
<span class="s s68">Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and
upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches
zero.</span> <span class="s s69">Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy
to upvote.</span> <span class="s s71">If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by
the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it.</span> <span class="s s72">An amusing cartoon
takes less.</span> <span class="s s73">A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero,
because people vote it up without even reading it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site,
the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take
specific measures to prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff.</span> <span class="s s76">The most
common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic.</span> <span class="s s77">Pictures of
kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned.</span> <span class="s s78">This
keeps out most fluff, but not all of it.</span> <span class="s s79">Some links are both fluff,
in the sense of being very short, and also on topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">There's no single solution to that.</span> <span class="s s81">If a link is just an empty
rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it's on topic in the
sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real
standard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity.</span> <span class="s s82">If the
posts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes ban
it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed.</span> <span class="s s83">If a post
has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more
matter-of-fact.</span> <span class="s s84">This is especially necessary with links whose
titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit
"vote up if you believe such-and-such" posts, which are the most
extreme form of fluff.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the
links do.</span> <span class="s s86">The existence of aggregators has already affected what
they aggregate.</span> <span class="s s87">Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic
from aggregators&mdash;sometimes even specific ones.</span> <span class="s s88">(No, the irony
of this statement is not lost on me.</span><span class="s s89">) Then there are the more
sinister mutations, like linkjacking&mdash;posting a paraphrase of
someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original.</span>
<span class="s s90">These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what's good in an
article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to
plagiarism, the more survives.</span>
<span class="s s91">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">I think it's important that a site that kills submissions provide
a way for users to see what got killed if they want to.</span> <span class="s s93">That keeps
editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident
they'd know if the editors stopped being honest.</span> <span class="s s94">HN users can do
this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile.</span>
<span class="s s95">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">Comments</span></p>
<p><span class="s s97">Bad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions.</span>
<span class="s s98">While the quality of links on the frontpage of HN hasn't changed
much, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">There are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and
stupidity.</span> <span class="s s100">There is a lot of overlap between the two&mdash;mean
comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb&mdash;but
the strategies for dealing with them are different.</span> <span class="s s101">Meanness is
easier to control.</span> <span class="s s102">You can have rules saying one shouldn't be mean,
and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is
not so easily distinguishable.</span> <span class="s s104">Mean people are more likely to know
they're being mean than stupid people are to know they're being
stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s105">The most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long but
mistaken argument, but the dumb joke.</span> <span class="s s106">Long but mistaken arguments
are actually quite rare.</span> <span class="s s107">There is a strong correlation between
comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality
of comments on community sites, average length would be a good
predictor.</span> <span class="s s108">Probably the cause is human nature rather than anything
specific to comment threads.</span> <span class="s s109">Probably it's simply that stupidity
more often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short.</span> <span class="s s111">And since
it's hard to write a short comment that's distinguished for the
amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish them
instead by being funny.</span> <span class="s s112">The most tempting format for stupid comments
is the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs are
the easiest form of humor.</span> 
<span class="s s113">[5]
So one advantage of forbidding
meanness is that it also cuts down on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">Bad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly.</span> <span class="s s115">Comments have
much more effect on new comments than submissions have on new
submissions.</span> <span class="s s116">If someone submits a lame article, the other submissions
don't all become lame.</span> <span class="s s117">But if someone posts a stupid comment on a
thread, that sets the tone for the region around it.</span> <span class="s s118">People reply
to dumb jokes with dumb jokes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">Maybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond to
a comment, and make the length of the delay inversely proportional
to some prediction of its quality.</span> <span class="s s120">Then dumb threads would grow
slower.</span>
<span class="s s121">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">People</span></p>
<p><span class="s s123">I notice most of the techniques I've described are conservative:
they're aimed at preserving the character of the site rather than
enhancing it.</span> <span class="s s124">I don't think that's a bias of mine.</span> <span class="s s125">It's due to
the shape of the problem.</span> <span class="s s126">Hacker News had the good fortune to start
out good, so in this case it's literally a matter of preservation.</span>
<span class="s s127">But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different
origins.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">The good things in a community site come from people more than
technology; it's mainly in the prevention of bad things that
technology comes into play.</span> <span class="s s129">Technology certainly can enhance
discussion.</span> <span class="s s130">Nested comments do, for example.</span> <span class="s s131">But I'd rather use
a site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a more
advanced one whose users were idiots or trolls.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s132">So the most important thing a community site can do is attract the
kind of people it wants.</span> <span class="s s133">A site trying to be as big as possible
wants to attract everyone.</span> <span class="s s134">But a site aiming at a particular subset
of users has to attract just those&mdash;and just as importantly,
repel everyone else.</span> <span class="s s135">I've made a conscious effort to do this on
HN.</span> <span class="s s136">The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules
discourage dramatic link titles.</span> <span class="s s137">The goal is that the only thing
to interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be the
ideas expressed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s138">The downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that,
to those people, it can be too attractive.</span> <span class="s s139">I'm all too aware how
addictive Hacker News can be.</span> <span class="s s140">For me, as for many users, it's a
kind of virtual town square.</span> <span class="s s141">When I want to take a break from
working, I walk into the square, just as I might into Harvard Square
or University Ave in the physical world.</span>
<span class="s s142">[7]
But an online square is
more dangerous than a physical one.</span> <span class="s s143">If I spent half the day loitering
on University Ave, I'd notice.</span> <span class="s s144">I have to walk a mile to get there,
and sitting in a cafe feels different from working.</span> <span class="s s145">But visiting
an online forum takes just a click, and feels superficially very
much like working.</span> <span class="s s146">You may be wasting your time, but you're not
idle.</span> <span class="s s147">Someone is wrong on the Internet, and you're fixing the
problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s148">Hacker News is definitely useful.</span> <span class="s s149">I've learned a lot from things
I've read on HN.</span> <span class="s s150">I've written several essays that began as comments
there.</span> <span class="s s151">So I wouldn't want the site to go away.</span> <span class="s s152">But I would like
to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity.</span> <span class="s s153">What a disaster
that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that
caused them to waste lots of time.</span> <span class="s s154">I wish I could be 100% sure
that's not a description of HN.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s155">I feel like the addictiveness of games and social applications is
still a mostly unsolved problem.</span> <span class="s s156">The situation now is like it was
with crack in the 1980s: we've invented terribly addictive new
things, and we haven't yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from
them.</span> <span class="s s157">We will eventually, and that's one of the problems I hope
to focus on next.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s158">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s159">[1]
I tried ranking users by both average and median comment
score, and average (with the high score thrown out) seemed the more
accurate predictor of high quality.</span> <span class="s s160">Median may be the more accurate
predictor of low quality though.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">[2]
Another thing I learned from this experiment is that if you're
going to distinguish between people, you better be sure you do it
right.</span> <span class="s s162">This is one problem where rapid prototyping doesn't work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s163">Indeed, that's the intellectually honest argument for not discriminating
between various types of people.</span> <span class="s s164">The reason not to do it is not
that everyone's the same, but that it's bad to do wrong and hard
to do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s165">[3]
When I catch egregiously linkjacked posts I replace the url
with that of whatever they copied.</span> <span class="s s166">Sites that habitually linkjack
get banned.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s167">[4]
Digg is notorious for its lack of transparency.</span> <span class="s s168">The root of
the problem is not that the guys running Digg are especially sneaky,
but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their frontpage.</span>
<span class="s s169">Instead of bubbling up from the bottom as they get more votes, as
on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new
arrivals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s170">The reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot,
while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular.</span> <span class="s s171">Digg is Slashdot
with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular
with voting instead of bookmarking.</span> <span class="s s172">(You can still see fossils of
their origins in their graphic design.</span><span class="s s173">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">Digg's algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story
that makes it onto the frontpage is the new top story.</span> <span class="s s175">Which in
turn forces Digg to respond with extreme countermeasures.</span> <span class="s s176">A lot
of startups have some kind of secret about the subterfuges they had
to resort to in the early days, and I suspect Digg's is the extent
to which the top stories were de facto chosen by human editors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s177">[5]
The dialog on Beavis and Butthead was composed largely of
these, and when I read comments on really bad sites I can hear them
in their voices.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">[6]
I suspect most of the techniques for discouraging stupid
comments have yet to be discovered.</span> <span class="s s179">Xkcd implemented a particularly
clever one in its IRC channel: don't allow the same thing twice.</span>
<span class="s s180">Once someone has said "fail," no one can ever say it again.</span> <span class="s s181">This
would penalize short comments especially, because they have less
room to avoid collisions in.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">Another promising idea is the stupid 
filter, which is just like a
probabilistic spam filter, but trained on corpora of stupid and
non-stupid comments instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s183">You may not have to kill bad comments to solve the problem.</span> <span class="s s184">Comments
at the bottom of a long thread are rarely seen, so it may be enough
to incorporate a prediction of quality in the comment sorting
algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s185">[7]
What makes most suburbs so demoralizing is that there's no
center to walk to.</span></p>
