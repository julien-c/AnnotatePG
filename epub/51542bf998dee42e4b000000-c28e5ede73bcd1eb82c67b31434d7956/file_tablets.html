<p><span class="s s2">December 2010</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">I was thinking recently how inconvenient it was not to have a general
term for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things running
Android.</span> <span class="s s4">The closest to a general term seems to be "mobile devices,"
but that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn't really
capture what's distinctive about the iPad.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">After a few seconds it struck me that what we'll end up calling
these things is tablets.</span> <span class="s s6">The only reason we even consider calling
them "mobile devices" is that the iPhone preceded the iPad.</span> <span class="s s7">If the
iPad had come first, we wouldn't think of the iPhone as a phone;
we'd think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">The iPhone isn't so much a phone as a replacement for a phone.</span>
<span class="s s9">That's an important distinction, because it's an early instance of
what will become a common pattern.</span> <span class="s s10">Many if not most of the
special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps
running on tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, and
cameras.</span> <span class="s s12">But I think it will surprise people how many things are
going to get replaced.</span> <span class="s s13">We funded one startup that's replacing keys.</span>
<span class="s s14">The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad
effectively replaces reading glasses.</span> <span class="s s15">I wouldn't be surprised if
by playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could even
replace the bathroom scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">The advantages of doing things in software on a single device are
so great that everything that can get turned into software will.</span>
<span class="s s17">So for the next couple years, a good recipe for startups
will be to look around you for things that people haven't realized
yet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the term ephemeralization to
describe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced
by what we would now call software.</span> <span class="s s19">The reason tablets are going
to take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co are
industrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind
them.</span> <span class="s s20">The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that
will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.</span> <span class="s s21">No one
who has studied the history of technology would want to underestimate
the power of that force.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behind
them.</span> <span class="s s23">I don't want to see another era of client monoculture like
the Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.</span> <span class="s s24">But if ephemeralization is
one of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggests
a way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets have
accelerometers in them.</span> <span class="s s26">Developers have used the accelerometer in
ways Apple could never have imagined.</span> <span class="s s27">That's the nature of platforms.
The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people
will use it.</span> <span class="s s28">So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can
we put in there?</span> <span class="s s29">Not merely hardware, but software too.</span> <span class="s s30">What else
can we give developers access to?</span> <span class="s s31">Give hackers an inch and they'll
take you a mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and
Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">Note: The original version of this essay used the term
"etherealization" instead of "ephemeralization," but apparently
the former was an alternative name suggested to Fuller by 
someone else; he preferred the latter.</span></p>
