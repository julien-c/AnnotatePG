  <h2><span class="s s1">Hiring is Obsolete</span></h2>
<div><div>
<span class="s s2">May 2005(This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA.</span><span class="s s3">)The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo, Google, and
Microsoft.</span> <span class="s s4">Average age of their founders: 24.</span> <span class="s s5">So it is pretty
well established now that grad students can start successful
companies.</span> <span class="s s6">And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads?</span><span class="s s7">Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startup
has decreased dramatically.</span> <span class="s s8">Now it's so low that it has disappeared
into the noise.</span> <span class="s s9">The main cost of starting a Web-based
startup is food and rent.</span> <span class="s s10">Which means it doesn't cost much more
to start a company than to be a total slacker.</span> <span class="s s11">You can probably
start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you're
prepared to live on ramen.</span><span class="s s12">The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permission
of investors to do it.</span> <span class="s s13">So a lot of people will be able to start
companies now who never could have before.</span><span class="s s14">The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties.</span>
<span class="s s15">I'm not so excited about founders who have everything investors
want except intelligence, or everything except energy.</span> <span class="s s16">The most
promising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold are
those who have everything investors want except experience.</span><span class="s s17">Market RateI once claimed that nerds were unpopular
in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do
than work full-time at being popular.</span> <span class="s s18">Some said I was just telling
people what they wanted to hear.</span> <span class="s s19">Well, I'm now about to do that
in a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued.</span><span class="s s20">Or more precisely, I think few realize the huge
spread in the value of 20 year olds.</span> <span class="s s21">Some, it's true, are not very
capable.</span> <span class="s s22">But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30
year olds.</span> <span class="s s23">[1]Till now the problem has always been that it's difficult to pick
them out.</span> <span class="s s24">Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time,
would try to invest in Microsoft.</span> <span class="s s25">But which would have then?</span> <span class="s s26">How
many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was
Bill Gates?</span><span class="s s27">It's hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b)
there is great variation between them, and (c) they're individually
inconsistent.</span> <span class="s s28">That last one is a big problem.</span> <span class="s s29">When you're young,
you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you're smart.</span>
<span class="s s30">So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things,
as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you're going to
get a lot of false positives.</span><span class="s s31">Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only
aware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high.</span> 
<span class="s s32">And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone
had to begin as a trainee in some 
entry-level job.</span> <span class="s s33">Organizations 
realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, but
instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in the
belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start 
at the bottom, so they didn't get swelled heads.</span><span class="s s34">The most productive young people will always be undervalued
by large organizations, because the young have no performance to
measure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend 
toward the mean.</span><span class="s s35">What's an especially productive 22 year old to do?</span> <span class="s s36">One thing you 
can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users.</span>
<span class="s s37">Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for
the customer.</span> <span class="s s38">The rate at which they value you (though they may
not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to 
the user.</span> <span class="s s39">But there's a way to appeal their judgement.</span> <span class="s s40">If you
want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your
own company.</span><span class="s s41">The market is a lot more discerning than any employer.</span> <span class="s s42">And it is
completely non-discriminatory.</span> <span class="s s43">On the Internet, nobody knows you're
a dog.</span> <span class="s s44">And more to the point, nobody knows you're 22.</span> <span class="s s45">All users
care about is whether your site or software gives them what they
want.</span> <span class="s s46">They don't care if the person behind it is a high school 
kid.</span><span class="s s47">If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate
for you?</span> <span class="s s48">Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big
company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get
you?</span><span class="s s49">When most people hear the word "startup," they think of the famous 
ones that have gone public.</span> <span class="s s50">But most startups that succeed do it
by getting bought.</span> <span class="s s51">And usually the acquirer doesn't just want the
technology, but the people who created it as well.</span><span class="s s52">Often big companies buy startups before they're profitable.</span> <span class="s s53">Obviously
in such cases they're not after revenues.</span> <span class="s s54">What they want is the 
development team and the software they've built so far.</span> <span class="s s55">When a
startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it's really
more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition.</span><span class="s s56">I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it 
will be better for everyone.</span> <span class="s s57">It's obviously better for the people
who start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money up
front.</span> <span class="s s58">But I think it will be better for the acquirers too.</span> <span class="s s59">The
central problem in big companies, and the main reason they're so 
much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty of
valuing each person's work.</span> <span class="s s60">Buying larval startups solves that 
problem for them: the acquirer doesn't pay till the developers have
proven themselves.</span> <span class="s s61">Acquirers are protected on the downside, but 
still get most of the upside.</span><span class="s s62">Product DevelopmentBuying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies:
they can't do product development.</span> <span class="s s63">Big companies are good at
extracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating 
new ones.</span><span class="s s64">Why?</span> <span class="s s65">It's worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this 
is the raison d'etre of startups.</span><span class="s s66">To start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect,
and this tends to warp their development decisions.</span> <span class="s s67">For example,
Web-based applications are hot now, but
within Microsoft there must
be a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-based
software threatens the desktop.</span> <span class="s s68">So any Web-based application that 
Microsoft ends up with, will probably, like Hotmail, be something 
developed outside the company.</span><span class="s s69">Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products is
that the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power in
big companies (unless they happen to be the CEO).</span> <span class="s s70">Disruptive
technologies are developed by disruptive people.</span> <span class="s s71">And they either
don't work for the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-men
and have comparatively little influence.</span><span class="s s72">Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of each
thing.</span> <span class="s s73">When you only have one Web browser, you can't do anything
really risky with it.</span> <span class="s s74">If ten different startups design ten different
Web browsers and you take the best, you'll probably get something
better.</span><span class="s s75">The more general version of this problem is that there are too many
new ideas for companies to explore them all.</span> <span class="s s76">There might be 500 
startups right now who think they're making something Microsoft
might buy.</span> <span class="s s77">Even Microsoft probably couldn't manage 500 development
projects in-house.</span><span class="s s78">Big companies also don't pay people the right way.</span> <span class="s s79">People developing
a new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whether
it succeeds or fails.</span> <span class="s s80">People at a startup expect to get rich if
the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails.</span> <span class="s s81">[2] So naturally
the people at the startup work a lot harder.</span><span class="s s82">The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle.</span> <span class="s s83">In startups, 
developers are often forced to talk directly to users, whether they
want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and support.</span>
<span class="s s84">It's painful doing sales, but you learn much more from
trying to sell people something than reading what 
they said in focus groups.</span><span class="s s85">And then of course, big companies are bad at product development 
because they're bad at everything.</span> <span class="s s86">Everything happens slower in
big companies than small ones, and product development is something
that has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of 
iterations to get something good.</span><span class="s s87">TrendI think the trend of big companies buying startups will only
accelerate.</span> <span class="s s88">One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride.</span> <span class="s s89">Most 
companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able to
develop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree 
an admission of failure.</span> <span class="s s90">And so, as people generally do with
admissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible.</span>
<span class="s s91">That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens.</span><span class="s s92">What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they're
young, before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs
hundreds of millions to acquire.</span> <span class="s s93">Much of what VCs add, the acquirer
doesn't need anyway.</span><span class="s s94">Why don't acquirers try to predict the companies they're going to
have to buy for hundreds of millions, and grab them early for a 
tenth or a twentieth of that?</span> <span class="s s95">Because they can't predict the winners
in advance?</span> <span class="s s96">If they're only paying a twentieth as much, they only
have to predict a twentieth as well.</span> <span class="s s97">Surely they can manage that.</span><span class="s s98">I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to 
go after earlier stage startups.</span> <span class="s s99">They won't necessarily buy them
outright.</span> <span class="s s100">The solution may be some hybrid of investment and
acquisition: for example, to buy a chunk of the company and get an
option to buy the rest later.</span><span class="s s101">When companies buy startups, they're effectively fusing recruiting 
and product development.</span> <span class="s s102">And I think that's more efficient than 
doing the two separately, because you always get people who are
really committed to what they're working on.</span><span class="s s103">Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work well
together.</span> <span class="s s104">Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under 
the very hot iron of running a startup.</span> <span class="s s105">By the time the acquirer 
gets them, they're finishing one another's sentences.</span> <span class="s s106">That's 
valuable in software, because so many bugs occur at the boundaries 
between different people's code.</span><span class="s s107">InvestorsThe increasing cheapness of starting a company doesn't just give
hackers more power relative to employers.</span> <span class="s s108">It also gives them more 
power relative to investors.</span><span class="s s109">The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn't be 
allowed to run their own companies.</span> <span class="s s110">The founders are supposed to 
accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take on some title like 
Chief Technical Officer.</span> <span class="s s111">There may be cases where this is a good 
idea.</span> <span class="s s112">But I think founders will increasingly be able to push back
in the matter of control, because they just don't need the investors'
money as much as they used to.</span><span class="s s113">Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon.</span> <span class="s s114">Fairchild Semiconductor
is considered the first VC-backed startup, and they were founded 
in 1959, less than fifty years ago.</span> <span class="s s115">Measured on the time scale of 
social change, what we have now is pre-beta.</span> <span class="s s116">So we shouldn't assume
the way startups work now is the way they have to work.</span><span class="s s117">Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started.</span> <span class="s s118">They had to build
actual factories.</span> <span class="s s119">What does the first round of venture funding for
a Web-based startup get spent on today?</span> <span class="s s120">More money can't get
software written faster; it isn't needed for facilities, because
those can now be quite cheap; all money can really buy you is sales
and marketing.</span> <span class="s s121">A sales force is worth something, I'll admit.</span> <span class="s s122">But
marketing is increasingly irrelevant.</span> <span class="s s123">On the Internet, anything
genuinely good will spread by word of mouth.</span><span class="s s124">Investors' power comes from money.</span> <span class="s s125">When startups need less money, 
investors have less power over them.</span> <span class="s s126">So future founders may not
have to accept new CEOs if they don't want them.</span> <span class="s s127">The VCs will have 
to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road, but like many
things people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward, it
may actually be good for them.</span><span class="s s128">Google is a sign of the way things are going.</span> <span class="s s129">As a condition of
funding, their investors insisted they hire someone old and experienced
as CEO.</span> <span class="s s130">But from what I've heard the founders didn't just give in
and take whoever the VCs wanted.</span> <span class="s s131">They delayed for an entire year,
and when they did finally take a CEO, they chose a guy with a PhD 
in computer science.</span><span class="s s132">It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerful
people in the company, and judging by Google's performance, their
youth and inexperience doesn't seem to have hurt them.</span> <span class="s s133">Indeed, I
suspect Google has done better than they would have if the founders
had given the VCs what they wanted, when they wanted it, and let 
some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding.</span><span class="s s134">I'm not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value.</span>
<span class="s s135">Certainly they have.</span> <span class="s s136">But they don't need to become the founders'
bosses, which is what that title CEO means.</span> <span class="s s137">I predict that in the 
future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOs
rather than CEOs.</span> <span class="s s138">The founders will run engineering directly, and
the rest of the company through the COO.</span><span class="s s139">The Open CageWith both employers and investors, the balance of power is slowly
shifting towards the young.</span> <span class="s s140">And yet they seem the last to realize
it.</span> <span class="s s141">Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting their
own company when they graduate.</span> <span class="s s142">Most just want to get a job.</span><span class="s s143">Maybe this is as it should be.</span> <span class="s s144">Maybe if the idea of starting a 
startup is intimidating, you filter out the uncommitted.</span> <span class="s s145">But I 
suspect the filter is set a little too high.</span> <span class="s s146">I think there are
people who could, if they tried, start successful startups, and who
instead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of big
companies.</span><span class="s s147">Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages, they
don't always realize at first that the door's open?</span> <span class="s s148">Often they
have to be poked with a stick to get them out.</span> <span class="s s149">Something similar 
happened with blogs.</span> <span class="s s150">People could have been publishing online in 
1995, and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last couple
years.</span> <span class="s s151">In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitled
to publish their ideas, and that anyone else who did was a crank.</span>
<span class="s s152">Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants 
to do it, even print journalists.</span> <span class="s s153">But blogging has not taken off 
recently because of any technical innovation; it just took eight
years for everyone to realize the cage was open.</span><span class="s s154">I think most undergrads don't realize yet that the economic cage 
is open.</span> <span class="s s155">A lot have been told by their parents that the route to
success is to get a good job.</span> <span class="s s156">This was true when their parents
were in college, but it's less true now.</span> <span class="s s157">The route to success is
to build something valuable, and you don't have to be working for 
an existing company to do that.</span> <span class="s s158">Indeed, you can often do it better
if you're not.</span><span class="s s159">When I talk to undergrads, what surprises me most about them is how
conservative they are.</span> <span class="s s160">Not politically, of course.</span> <span class="s s161">I mean they
don't seem to want to take risks.</span> <span class="s s162">This is a mistake, because the
younger you are, the more risk you can take.</span><span class="s s163">RiskRisk and reward are always proportionate.</span> <span class="s s164">For example, stocks are
riskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns.</span> <span class="s s165">So
why does anyone invest in bonds?</span> <span class="s s166">The catch is that phrase "over
time.</span><span class="s s167">"</span> <span class="s s168">Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, but
they might lose value from year to year.</span> <span class="s s169">So what you should invest
in depends on how soon you need the money.</span> <span class="s s170">If you're young, you 
should take the riskiest investments you can find.</span><span class="s s171">All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical.</span> <span class="s s172">Most
undergrads probably have more debts than assets.</span> <span class="s s173">They may feel
they have nothing to invest.</span> <span class="s s174">But that's not true: they have their
time to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there.</span> <span class="s s175">Your
early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks.</span><span class="s s176">The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market 
forces make it so.</span> <span class="s s177">People will pay extra for stability.</span> <span class="s s178">So if you
choose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a big
company-- it's going to cost you.</span><span class="s s179">Riskier career moves pay better on average, because there is less
demand for them.</span> <span class="s s180">Extreme choices like starting a startup are so 
frightening that most people won't even try.</span> <span class="s s181">So you don't end up 
having as much competition as you might expect, considering the
prizes at stake.</span><span class="s s182">The math is brutal.</span> <span class="s s183">While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the 
one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what
they would have made in an ordinary job.</span> <span class="s s184">[3]
That's the sense in
which startups pay better "on average.</span><span class="s s185">"</span><span class="s s186">Remember that.</span> <span class="s s187">If you start a startup, you'll probably fail.</span> <span class="s s188">Most
startups fail.</span> <span class="s s189">It's the nature of the business.</span> <span class="s s190">But it's not
necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance of
failing, if you can afford the risk.</span> <span class="s s191">Failing at 40, when you have 
a family to support, could be serious.</span> <span class="s s192">But if you fail at 22, so 
what?</span> <span class="s s193">If you try to start a startup right out of college and it 
tanks, you'll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter.</span> <span class="s s194">Which, if you
think about it, is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate 
program.</span><span class="s s195">Even if your startup does tank, you won't harm your prospects with
employers.</span> <span class="s s196">To make sure I asked some friends who work for big
companies.</span> <span class="s s197">I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and
Microsoft how they'd feel about two candidates, both 24, with equal
ability, one who'd tried to start a startup that tanked, and another
who'd spent the two years since college working as a developer at
a big company.</span> <span class="s s198">Every one responded that they'd prefer the guy who'd
tried to start his own company.</span> <span class="s s199">Zod Nazem, who's in charge of 
engineering at Yahoo, said:
 I actually put more value on the guy with the failed
 startup.</span> <span class="s s200">And you can quote me!</span> 
<span class="s s201">So there you have it.</span> <span class="s s202">Want to get hired by Yahoo?</span> <span class="s s203">Start your own 
company.</span><span class="s s204">The Man is the CustomerIf even big employers think highly of young hackers who start
companies, why don't more do it?</span> <span class="s s205">Why are undergrads so conservative?</span>
<span class="s s206">I think it's because they've spent so much time in institutions.</span><span class="s s207">The first twenty years of everyone's life consists of being piped
from one institution to another.</span> <span class="s s208">You probably didn't have much
choice about the secondary schools you went to.</span> <span class="s s209">And after high
school it was probably understood that you were supposed to go to
college.</span> <span class="s s210">You may have had a few different colleges to choose
between, but they were probably pretty similar.</span> <span class="s s211">So by this point
you've been riding on a subway line for twenty years, and the next
stop seems to be a job.</span><span class="s s212">Actually college is where the line ends.</span> <span class="s s213">Superficially, going to
work for a company may feel like just the next in a series of 
institutions, but underneath, everything is different.</span> <span class="s s214">The end of
school is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from 
net consumer to net producer.</span><span class="s s215">The other big change is that now, you're steering.</span> <span class="s s216">You can go
anywhere you want.</span> <span class="s s217">So it may be worth standing back and understanding
what's going on, instead of just doing the default thing.</span><span class="s s218">All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads 
have been thinking about what employers want.</span> <span class="s s219">But what really 
matters is what customers want, because they're the ones who give
employers the money to pay you.</span><span class="s s220">So instead of thinking about what employers want, you're probably
better off thinking directly about what users want.</span> <span class="s s221">To the extent 
there's any difference between the two, you can even use that to
your advantage if you start a company of your own.</span> <span class="s s222">For example,
big companies like docile conformists.</span> <span class="s s223">But this is merely an
artifact of their bigness, not something customers need.</span><span class="s s224">Grad SchoolI didn't consciously realize all this when I was graduating from 
college-- partly because I went straight to grad school.</span> <span class="s s225">Grad
school can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day 
starting a startup.</span> <span class="s s226">You can start one when you're done, or even
pull the ripcord part way through, like the founders of Yahoo and
Google.</span><span class="s s227">Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you're
collected together with a lot of smart people, and you have bigger 
chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad or
corporate employee would.</span> <span class="s s228">As long as you have a fairly tolerant
advisor, you can take your time developing an idea before turning 
it into a company.</span> <span class="s s229">David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo 
directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a day
by the fall, but they didn't actually drop out of grad school and
start a company till March 1995.</span><span class="s s230">You could also try the startup first, and if it doesn't work, then
go to grad school.</span> <span class="s s231">When startups tank they usually do it fairly
quickly.</span> <span class="s s232">Within a year you'll know if you're wasting your time.</span><span class="s s233">If it fails, that is.</span> <span class="s s234">If it succeeds, you may have to delay grad
school a little longer.</span> <span class="s s235">But you'll have a much more enjoyable life 
once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend.</span><span class="s s236">ExperienceAnother reason people in their early twenties don't start startups
is that they feel they don't have enough experience.</span> <span class="s s237">Most investors
feel the same.</span><span class="s s238">I remember hearing a lot of that word "experience" when I was in 
college.</span> <span class="s s239">What do people really mean by it?</span> <span class="s s240">Obviously it's not the
experience itself that's valuable, but something it changes in your
brain.</span> <span class="s s241">What's different about your brain after you have "experience,"
and can you make that change happen faster?</span><span class="s s242">I now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be 
missing when people lack experience.</span> <span class="s s243">I've said that every 
startup needs three things: to start with good people,
to make something users want, and not to spend too much money.</span> <span class="s s244">It's
the middle one you get wrong when you're inexperienced.</span> <span class="s s245">There are 
plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write good
software, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money.</span>
<span class="s s246">If they get something wrong, it's usually not realizing they have 
to make something people want.</span><span class="s s247">This is not exclusively a failing of the young.</span> <span class="s s248">It's common for
startup founders of all ages to build things no one wants.</span><span class="s s249">Fortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix.</span> <span class="s s250">If undergrads were 
all bad programmers, the problem would be a lot harder.</span> <span class="s s251">It can 
take years to learn how to program.</span> <span class="s s252">But I don't think it takes 
years to learn how to make things people want.</span> <span class="s s253">My hypothesis is
that all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the head
and tell them: Wake up.</span> <span class="s s254">Don't sit here making up a priori theories
about what users need.</span> <span class="s s255">Go find some users and see what they need.</span><span class="s s256">Most successful startups not only do something very specific, but 
solve a problem people already know they have.</span><span class="s s257">The big change that "experience" causes in your brain is learning
that you need to solve people's problems. Once you grasp that, you
advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring out what those
problems are.</span> <span class="s s258">And that takes some effort, because the way software
actually gets used, especially by the people who pay the most for
it, is not at all what you might expect.</span> <span class="s s259">For example, the stated 
purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas.</span> <span class="s s260">Its real role is to 
overcome people's fear of public speaking.</span> <span class="s s261">It allows you to give
an impressive-looking talk about nothing, and it causes the audience
to sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one 
looking at you.</span><span class="s s262">This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see.</span> <span class="s s263">The key is to
know to look for it-- to realize that having an idea for a startup
is not like having an idea for a class project.</span> <span class="s s264">The goal in a
startup is not to write a cool piece of software.</span> <span class="s s265">It's to make 
something people want.</span> <span class="s s266">And to do that you have to look at users--
forget about hacking, and just look at users.</span> <span class="s s267">This can be quite a
mental adjustment, because little if any of the software you write
in school even has users.</span> <span class="s s268">A few steps before a Rubik's Cube is solved, it still looks like a
mess.</span> <span class="s s269">I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a 
similar position: they're only a few steps away from being able to
start successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don't realize
it.</span> <span class="s s270">They have more than enough technical skill.</span> <span class="s s271">They just haven't
realized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users 
want, and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk 
is pooled.</span><span class="s s272">If you're young and smart, you don't need either of those.</span> <span class="s s273">You
don't need someone else to tell you what users want, because you 
can figure it out yourself.</span> <span class="s s274">And you don't want to pool risk, because
the younger you are, the more risk you should take.</span><span class="s s275">A Public Service MessageI'd like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents.</span>
<span class="s s276">Don't drop out of college to start a startup.</span> <span class="s s277">There's no rush.</span> 
<span class="s s278">There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate.</span>
<span class="s s279">In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing company
for a couple years after you graduate, to learn how companies work.</span><span class="s s280">And yet, when I think about it, I can't imagine telling Bill Gates
at 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company.</span> 
<span class="s s281">He'd have told me to get lost.</span> <span class="s s282">And could I have honestly claimed
that he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working
at ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would have
if he'd been taking classes back at Harvard?</span> <span class="s s283">No, probably not.</span><span class="s s284">And yes, while it is probably true that you'll learn some valuable
things by going to work for an existing company for a couple years
before starting your own, you'd learn a thing or two running your 
own company during that time too.</span><span class="s s285">The advice about going to work for someone else would get an even
colder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates.</span> <span class="s s286">So I'm supposed 
to finish college, then go work for another company for two years,
and then I can start my own?</span> <span class="s s287">I have to wait till I'm 23?</span> <span class="s s288">That's 
four years.</span> <span class="s s289">That's more than twenty percent of my life so
far.</span> <span class="s s290">Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money 
writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair.</span><span class="s s291">And he'd be right.</span> <span class="s s292">The Apple II was launched just two years later.</span>
<span class="s s293">In fact, if Bill had finished college and gone to work for another
company as we're suggesting, he might well have gone to work for
Apple.</span> <span class="s s294">And while that would probably have been better for all of
us, it wouldn't have been better for him.</span><span class="s s295">So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and
then go work for a while before starting a startup, I have to admit
it's one of those things the old tell the young, but don't expect
them to listen to.</span> <span class="s s296">We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claim
we warned you.</span> <span class="s s297">So don't say I didn't warn you.</span><span class="s s298">Notes[1]
