  <h2><span class="s s1">A Local Revolution?</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">April 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Recently I realized I'd been holding two ideas in my head that would explode if combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">The first is that startups may represent a new economic phase, on the scale of the Industrial Revolution.</span> <span class="s s5">I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true.</span> <span class="s s6">People are dramatically more 
productive as founders or early employees of startups&acirc;&#128;&#148;imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company&acirc;&#128;&#148;and that scale of improvement can change social customs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that specialize in it&mdash;that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance.</span> <span class="s s8">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">What if both are true? What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary.</span> <span class="s s11">All previous revolutions have spread.</span> <span class="s s12">Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely.</span> <span class="s s13">If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have novel consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well.</span> <span class="s s15">The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton &amp; Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America.</span> <span class="s s17">Industrialization didn't spread much beyond those regions for a while.</span> <span class="s s18">It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class&mdash;countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated.</span> <span class="s s19">Otherwise it wasn't worth investing in factories.</span> <span class="s s20">But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root.</span> <span class="s s21">An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one.</span> <span class="s s22">So steam engines spread fast.</span> <span class="s s23">And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials.</span> 
 <span class="s s24">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography.</span> <span class="s s26">An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine.</span> <span class="s s27">This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business.</span> <span class="s s28">[3]
 Plus there aren't the same forces driving startups to spread.</span> <span class="s s29">Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them.</span> <span class="s s30">An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market.</span> <span class="s s31">But this isn't true with startups.</span> <span class="s s32">There's no need for a Microsoft of France or Google of Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">Governments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can't call them into being the way a genuine need could.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">How will this all play out?</span> <span class="s s35">If I had to predict now, I'd say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won't work) or by market need (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far.</span> <span class="s s36">And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed.</span> <span class="s s38">Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home.</span> <span class="s s39">Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings.</span> <span class="s s40">Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world.</span> <span class="s s41">And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">But of course it's not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston.</span> <span class="s s43">There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">Boston's case illustrates the difficulty you'd have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game.</span> <span class="s s45">If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, the 
way to do it would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there.</span> <span class="s s46">Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors.</span> <span class="s s47">That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley.</span> <span class="s s48">But Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with.</span> <span class="s s49">If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">Recently I suggested a potential shortcut: 
pay startups to move.</span> <span class="s s51">Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction.</span> <span class="s s52">Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.</span> <span class="s s54">I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the random factors that have driven it so far, but (3) that these factors will be increasingly outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.</span> <span class="s s56">Result: this revolution, if it is one, will be unusually localized.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">[1]
There are two very different types of startup: one kind that evolves naturally, and one kind that's called into being to "commercialize" a scientific discovery.</span> <span class="s s59">Most computer/software startups are now the first type, and most pharmaceutical startups the second.</span> <span class="s s60">When I talk about startups in this essay, I mean type I startups.</span> <span class="s s61">There is no difficulty making type II startups spread: all you have to do is fund medical research labs; commercializing whatever new discoveries the boffins throw off is as straightforward as building a new airport.</span> <span class="s s62">Type II startups neither require nor produce startup culture.</span> <span class="s s63">But that means having type II startups won't get you type I startups.</span> <span class="s s64">Philadelphia is a case in point: lots of type II startups, but hardly any type I.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">Incidentally, Google may appear to be an instance of a type II startup, but it wasn't.</span> <span class="s s66">Google is not pagerank commercialized.</span> <span class="s s67">They could have used another algorithm and everything would have turned out the same.</span> <span class="s s68">What made Google Google is that they cared about doing search well at a critical point in the evolution of the web.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">[2]
 Watt didn't invent the steam engine.</span> <span class="s s70">His critical invention was a refinement that made steam engines dramatically more efficient: the separate condenser.</span> <span class="s s71">But that oversimplifies his role.</span> <span class="s s72">He had such a different attitude to the problem and approached it with such energy that he transformed the field.</span> <span class="s s73">Perhaps the most accurate way to put it would be to say that Watt reinvented the steam engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">[3]
The biggest counterexample here is Skype.</span> <span class="s s75">If you're doing
something that would get shut down in the US, it becomes an 
advantage to be located elsewhere.</span> <span class="s s76">That's why Kazaa took
the place of Napster.</span> <span class="s s77">And the expertise and connections the 
founders gained from running Kazaa helped ensure the success
of Skype.</span></p>
