<p><span class="s s2">
March 2008, rev. June 2008</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Technology tends to separate normal from natural.</span> <span class="s s4">Our bodies
weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or
to get so little exercise.</span> 
<span class="s s5">There may be a similar problem with the way we work: 
a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour
or sugar is for us physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">I began to suspect this after spending several years working 
with startup founders.</span> <span class="s s7">I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've
noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their
own startups and those working for large organizations.</span>
<span class="s s8">I wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;
starting a startup can be very stressful.</span> <span class="s s9">Maybe the best way to put
it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is
happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating
doughnuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be
working in a way that's more natural for humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that
I'd only seen in zoos before.</span> <span class="s s12">It was remarkable how different they
seemed.</span> <span class="s s13">Particularly lions.</span> <span class="s s14">Lions in the wild seem about ten times
more alive.</span> <span class="s s15">They're like different animals.</span> <span class="s s16">I suspect that working
for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living
in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.</span>
<span class="s s17">Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed
for.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s18">Trees</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">What's so unnatural about working for a big company? The root of
the problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large
groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that
each species thrives in groups of a certain size.</span> <span class="s s21">A herd of impalas
might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.</span> <span class="s s22">Humans
also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about
hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own
experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8
work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50
is really unwieldy.</span>
<span class="s s23">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in
groups of several hundred.</span> <span class="s s25">And yet&mdash;for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature&mdash;a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide
themselves into units small enough to work together.</span> <span class="s s27">But to
coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s28">These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.</span> <span class="s s29">Your
boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.</span> <span class="s s30">But when
you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,
something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention
explicitly.</span> <span class="s s31">In the group one level up from yours, your boss
represents your entire group.</span> <span class="s s32">A group of 10 managers is not merely
a group of 10 people working together in the usual way.</span> <span class="s s33">It's really
a group of groups.</span> <span class="s s34">Which means for a group of 10 managers to work
together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group
working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single
person&mdash;the workers and manager would each share only one
person's worth of freedom between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were
one person.</span> <span class="s s36">But in a large organization divided into groups in
this way, the pressure is always in that direction.</span> <span class="s s37">Each group
tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals
that humans were designed to work in.</span> <span class="s s38">That was the point of creating
it.</span> <span class="s s39">And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that
each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the
size of the entire tree.</span>
<span class="s s40">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.</span> <span class="s s42">You
can feel the difference between working for a company with 100
employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">Corn Syrup</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake
tribe.</span> <span class="s s45">The number of people you interact with is about right.</span> <span class="s s46">But
something is missing: individual initiative.</span> <span class="s s47">Tribes of hunter-gatherers
have much more freedom.</span> <span class="s s48">The leaders have a little more power than other
members of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to
do and when the way a boss can.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">It's not your boss's fault.</span> <span class="s s50">The real problem is that in the group
above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.</span>
<span class="s s51">Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels
both right and wrong at the same time.</span> <span class="s s53">On the surface it feels
like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major
is missing.</span> <span class="s s54">A job at a big company is like high fructose corn
syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like,
but is disastrously lacking in others.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with
the usual sort of job.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,
at least for programmers.</span> <span class="s s57">How bad could it be?</span> <span class="s s58">Well, food shows
that pretty clearly.</span> <span class="s s59">If you were dropped at a random point in
America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.</span>
<span class="s s60">Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high
fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.</span> <span class="s s61">And yet if
you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably
find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.</span>
<span class="s s62">"Normal" food is terribly bad for you.</span> <span class="s s63">The only people who eat
what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing
weirdos in Berkeley.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">If "normal" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?</span> <span class="s s65">There are
two main reasons.</span> <span class="s s66">One is that it has more immediate appeal.</span> <span class="s s67">You
may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first
couple bites feels great.</span> <span class="s s68">The other is economies of scale.</span>
<span class="s s69">Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.</span>
<span class="s s70">Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth
spending a lot to market it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily
marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's
expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you
think most will choose?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">It's the same with work.</span> <span class="s s73">The average MIT graduate wants to work
at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe,
and they'll get paid a good salary right away.</span> <span class="s s74">It's the job
equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.</span> <span class="s s75">The drawbacks will
only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of
malaise.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like
the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley: though a tiny minority
of the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to.</span>
<span class="s s77">In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s78">Programmers</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on
programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new
things.</span> <span class="s s80">Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support
people answer much the same questions; but once you've written a
piece of code you don't need to write it again.</span> <span class="s s81">So a programmer
working as programmers are meant to is always making new things.</span>
<span class="s s82">And when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each
person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're
going to face resistance when you do something new.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.</span> <span class="s s84">It's true even
in the smartest companies.</span> <span class="s s85">I was talking recently to a founder who
considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to
work for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.</span>
<span class="s s86">He didn't learn as much as he expected.</span> <span class="s s87">Programmers learn by doing,
and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't&mdash;sometimes
because the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's
code wouldn't let him.</span> <span class="s s88">Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead
of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions
imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a
fraction of the things he would have liked to.</span> <span class="s s89">He said he has
learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has
to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at
least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.</span> <span class="s s91">If you're not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them.</span> <span class="s s92">And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.</span>
<span class="s s93">So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of
course.</span> <span class="s s95">But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big
company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing
the startup.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size
of company you work for.</span> <span class="s s97">If you start the company, you'll have the
most freedom.</span> <span class="s s98">If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll
have almost as much freedom as the founders.</span> <span class="s s99">Even a company with
100 people will feel different from one with 1000.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s100">Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.</span> <span class="s s101">The tree
structure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,
not a lower bound.</span> <span class="s s102">The head of a small company may still choose
to be a tyrant.</span> <span class="s s103">The point is that a large organization is compelled
by its structure to be one.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s104">Consequences</span></p>
<p><span class="s s105">That has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.</span>
<span class="s s106">One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,
no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.</span> <span class="s s107">It's a
consequence of the tree structure that every large organization is
forced to adopt.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if
they avoided tree structure.</span> <span class="s s109">And since human nature limits the
size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine
for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no
structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work
together the way components of a market economy do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s110">That might be worth exploring.</span> <span class="s s111">I suspect there are already some
highly partitionable businesses that lean this way.</span> <span class="s s112">But I don't
know any technology companies that have done it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves
as sponges: they can stay small.</span> <span class="s s114">If I'm right, then it really
pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.</span>
<span class="s s115">Particularly a technology company.</span> <span class="s s116">Which means it's doubly important
to hire the best people.</span> <span class="s s117">Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get
less done, but they also make you big, because you need more of
them to solve a given problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.</span> <span class="s s119">It will always
suck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,
the more it will suck.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s120">In an essay I wrote a couple years ago 
I advised graduating seniors
to work for a couple years for another company before starting their
own.</span> <span class="s s121">I'd modify that now.</span> <span class="s s122">Work for another company if you want
to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own
startup, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s123">The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately
was that I felt most would fail.</span> <span class="s s124">And they will.</span> <span class="s s125">But ambitious
programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than
going to work at a big company.</span> <span class="s s126">Certainly they'll learn more.</span> <span class="s s127">They
might even be better off financially.</span> <span class="s s128">A lot of people in their
early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even
faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.</span>
<span class="s s129">At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be
zero rather than negative.</span> 
<span class="s s130">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s131">We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have
enough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from
working for a big company.</span> <span class="s s132">The people who've worked for a few years
do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only
because they're that much older.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s133">The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of
conservative.</span> <span class="s s134">It's hard to say how much is because big companies
made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that
made them work for the big companies in the first place.</span> <span class="s s135">But
certainly a large part of it is learned.</span> <span class="s s136">I know because I've seen
it burn off.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s137">Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that
convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small
group, is the natural way for programmers to live.</span> <span class="s s138">Founders arriving
at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.</span> <span class="s s139">Three
months later they're transformed: they have so much more 
confidence
that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller.</span> 
<span class="s s140">[4]
Strange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same
time.</span> <span class="s s141">Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the
wild.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear
that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment&mdash;and
in particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to
programmers.</span> <span class="s s143">In the first couple weeks of working on their own
startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working
the way people are meant to.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">[1]
When I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a
certain way, I mean by evolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s146">[2]
It's not only the leaves who suffer.</span> <span class="s s147">The constraint propagates
up as well as down.</span> <span class="s s148">So managers are constrained too; instead of
just doing things, they have to act through subordinates.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s149">[3]
Do not finance your startup with credit cards.</span> <span class="s s150">Financing a
startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt
stupidest of all.</span> <span class="s s151">Credit card debt is a bad idea, period.</span> <span class="s s152">It is
a trap set by evil companies for the desperate and the foolish.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">[4]
The founders we fund used to be younger (initially we encouraged
undergrads to apply), and the first couple times I saw this I used
to wonder if they were actually getting physically taller.</span></p>
