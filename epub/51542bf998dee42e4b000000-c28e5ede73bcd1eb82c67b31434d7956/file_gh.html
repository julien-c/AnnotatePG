<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
July 2004</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)</span></p>
<p>
<span class="s s4">A few months ago I finished a new 
book, 
and in reviews I keep
noticing words like "provocative'' and "controversial.</span><span class="s s5">'</span><span class="s s6">' To say
nothing of "idiotic.</span><span class="s s7">'</span><span class="s s8">'</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">I didn't mean to make the book controversial.</span> <span class="s s10">I was trying to make
it efficient.</span> <span class="s s11">I didn't want to waste people's time telling them
things they already knew.</span> <span class="s s12">It's more efficient just to give them
the diffs.</span> <span class="s s13">But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">Edisons</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">There's no controversy about which idea is most controversial:
the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a
problem as we think.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s16">I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a
good thing.</span> <span class="s s17">I said in some situations it might be a sign of good
things.</span> <span class="s s18">A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be
a sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering
consciousness after being hit on the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.</span>
<span class="s s20">(In a society of one, they're identical.</span><span class="s s21">) And that
is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation
in productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas
Edison.</span> <span class="s s22">It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.</span>
<span class="s s24">If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how
much more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than
the worst?</span> <span class="s s25">A factor of two?</span> <span class="s s26">Whereas when you hand people a complex tool
like a computer, the variation in what they can do with
it is enormous.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">That's not a new idea.</span> <span class="s s28">Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and
the study he quoted was published in 1968.</span> <span class="s s29">But I think he
underestimated the variation between programmers.</span> <span class="s s30">He wrote about productivity in lines
of code: the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth
the time.</span> <span class="s s31">But what if the problem isn't given?</span> <span class="s s32">In programming, as
in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding
what problems to solve.</span> <span class="s s33">Imagination is hard to measure, but
in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured
in lines of code.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it
varies so much.</span> <span class="s s35">The variation between programmers
is so great that it becomes a difference in kind.</span> <span class="s s36">I don't
think this is something intrinsic to programming, though.</span> <span class="s s37">In every field,
technology magnifies differences in productivity.</span> <span class="s s38">I think what's
happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological
leverage.</span> <span class="s s39">But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the
variation we see is something that more and more fields will see
as time goes on.</span> <span class="s s40">And the success of companies, and countries, will
depend increasingly on how they deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the
contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be
disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.</span> <span class="s s42">When
you reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1%
of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,
or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these
especially productive people.</span> <span class="s s44">What motivates them?</span> <span class="s s45">What do they
need to do their jobs?</span> <span class="s s46">How do you recognize them?</span> <span class="s s47">How do you
get them to come and work for you?</span> <span class="s s48">And then of course there's the
question, how do you become one?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">More than Money</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">I know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about
what they have in common.</span> <span class="s s51">Their defining quality is probably that
they really love to program.</span> <span class="s s52">Ordinary programmers write code to pay
the bills.</span> <span class="s s53">Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,
and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.</span>
<span class="s s55">This isn't quite true.</span> <span class="s s56">It is true that all they really care about
is doing interesting work.</span> <span class="s s57">But if you make enough money, you get
to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are
attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.</span>
<span class="s s58">But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they
care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for
it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s59">Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because
it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what
they're worth.</span> <span class="s s60">A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times
as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky
to get paid three times as much.</span> <span class="s s61">As I'll explain later, this is
partly because great hackers don't know how good they are.</span> <span class="s s62">But
it's also because money is not the main thing they want.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">What do hackers want?</span> <span class="s s64">Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.</span>
<span class="s s65">In fact, that's an understatement.</span> <span class="s s66">Good hackers find it unbearable
to use bad tools.</span> <span class="s s67">They'll simply refuse to work on projects with
the wrong infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our
bulletin board was an ad from IBM.</span> <span class="s s69">It was a picture of an AS400,
and the headline read, I think, "hackers despise
it.</span><span class="s s70">'</span><span class="s s71">' [1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're
not just making a technical decision.</span> <span class="s s73">You're also making a social
decision, and this may be the more important of the two.</span> <span class="s s74">For
example, if your company wants to write some software, it might
seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.</span> <span class="s s75">But when you choose a
language, you're also choosing a community.</span> <span class="s s76">The programmers you'll
be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as
smart as the
ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.</span>
<span class="s s77">And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the
language you choose.</span> <span class="s s78">Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers
prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative
merits of those languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view
languages as standards.</span> <span class="s s80">They don't want to bet the company on
Betamax.</span> <span class="s s81">The thing about languages, though, is that they're not
just standards.</span> <span class="s s82">If you have to move bits over a network, by all
means use TCP/IP.</span> <span class="s s83">But a programming language isn't just a format.</span>
<span class="s s84">A programming language is a medium of expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular
language.</span> <span class="s s86">As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.</span> <span class="s s87">But as a
medium of expression, you could do a lot better.</span> <span class="s s88">Of all the great
programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily
program in Java.</span> <span class="s s89">And of all the great programmers I can think of
who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.</span>
<span class="s s91">Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.</span>
<span class="s s92">Good hackers insist on control.</span> <span class="s s93">This is part of what makes them
good hackers: when something's broken, they need to fix it.</span> <span class="s s94">You
want them to feel this way about the software they're writing for
you.</span> <span class="s s95">You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about
the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s96">A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new
startup he was involved with.</span> <span class="s s97">It sounded promising.</span> <span class="s s98">But the next
time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software
on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer
to be their chief technical officer.</span> <span class="s s99">When I heard this, I thought,
these guys are doomed.</span> <span class="s s100">One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate
hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have
had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine
a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have
a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had
to be built on NT.</span> <span class="s s101">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s102">The Final Frontier</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">After software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably
his office.</span> <span class="s s104">Big companies think the function of office space is to express
rank.</span> <span class="s s105">But hackers use their offices for more than that: they
use their office as a place to think in.</span> <span class="s s106">And if you're a technology
company, their thoughts are your product.</span> <span class="s s107">So making hackers work
in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory
where the air is full of soot.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with
good reason.</span> <span class="s s109">All the hackers I know despise them.</span> <span class="s s110">The mere prospect
of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on
hard problems. If you want to get real work done in an office with
cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or
late or on a weekend, when no one else is there.</span> <span class="s s111">Don't companies
realize this is a sign that something is broken?</span> <span class="s s112">An office
environment is supposed to be something that helps
you work, not something you work despite.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,
even the CEO.</span> <span class="s s114">But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously
they still view office space as a badge of rank.</span> <span class="s s115">Note too that
Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.</span>
<span class="s s116">They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where
presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s117">One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.</span>
<span class="s s118">I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a
door.</span> <span class="s s119">Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to
work where you can actually get work done.</span> <span class="s s120">And you know, Microsoft
is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop
software in house.</span> <span class="s s121">Not well, perhaps, but well enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at
what they do at home.</span> <span class="s s123">At home, hackers can arrange things themselves
so they can get the most done.</span> <span class="s s124">And when they work at home, hackers
don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.</span> <span class="s s125">They
work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere
to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass
boxes set in acres of parking lots.</span> <span class="s s126">They have a sofa they can take
a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at
their desk, pretending to work.</span> <span class="s s127">There's no crew of people with
vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime
hacking hours.</span> <span class="s s128">There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate
retreats or team-building exercises.</span> <span class="s s129">And when you look at what
they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I
said earlier about tools.</span> <span class="s s130">They may have to use Java and Windows
at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're
more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s131">Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular
language can be misleading.</span> <span class="s s132">What we ought to look at, if we want
to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can
choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.</span> <span class="s s133">When you ask
that question, you find that open source operating systems already
have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably
Perl.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s134">Interesting</span></p>
<p><span class="s s135">Along with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.</span> <span class="s s136">What
makes a project interesting?</span> <span class="s s137">Well, obviously overtly sexy
applications like stealth planes or special effects software would
be interesting to work on.</span> <span class="s s138">But any application can be interesting
if it poses novel technical challenges.</span> <span class="s s139">So it's hard to predict
which problems hackers will like, because some become
interesting only when the people working on them discover a new
kind of solution.</span> <span class="s s140">Before ITA
(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),
the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it
was one of the most boring applications imaginable.</span> <span class="s s141">But ITA made
it interesting by 
redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">I think the same thing happened at Google.</span> <span class="s s143">When Google was founded,
the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search
was boring and unimportant.</span> <span class="s s144">But the guys at Google didn't think
search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">This is an area where managers can make a difference.</span> <span class="s s146">Like a parent
saying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in
ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a
more interesting one.</span> <span class="s s147">Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at
this, in part simply by having high standards.</span> <span class="s s148">There were a lot
of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.</span> <span class="s s149">He redefined the
problem as: make one that's beautiful.</span> <span class="s s150">And that probably drove
the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s151">They certainly delivered.</span> <span class="s s152">When the Mac first appeared, you didn't
even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell
from the case.</span> <span class="s s153">A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in
Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac
carrying case.</span> <span class="s s154">I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.</span> <span class="s s155">I carried
it home and plugged it in, and it booted.</span> <span class="s s156">The happy Macintosh
face, and then the finder.</span> <span class="s s157">My God, it was so simple.</span> <span class="s s158">It was just
like .</span><span class="s s159">.</span><span class="s s160">.</span> <span class="s s161">Google.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s162">Hackers like to work for people with high standards.</span> <span class="s s163">But it's not
enough just to be exacting.</span> <span class="s s164">You have to insist on the right things.</span>
<span class="s s165">Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.</span> <span class="s s166">I've
seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.</span> <span class="s s167">Really
there should be two articles: one about what to do if
you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.</span> <span class="s s168">And the 
second could probably be condensed into two words: give up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s169">The problem is not so much the day to day management.</span> <span class="s s170">Really good
hackers are practically self-managing.</span> <span class="s s171">The problem is, if you're
not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.</span> <span class="s s172">A similar
problem explains why American cars are so ugly.</span> <span class="s s173">I call it the
design paradox.</span> <span class="s s174">You might think that you could make your products
beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.</span> <span class="s s175">But if
you yourself don't have good taste, 
how are you going to recognize
a good designer?</span> <span class="s s176">By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.</span>
<span class="s s177">And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,
because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by
fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.</span>
<span class="s s178">There's no way around it: you can't manage a process intended to
produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.</span> <span class="s s179">American
cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with
bad taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,
or even frivolous.</span> <span class="s s181">It is neither.</span> <span class="s s182">To drive design, a manager must
be the most demanding user of a company's products.</span> <span class="s s183">And if you
have really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying
you the kind of problem that good people like to work on.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s184">Nasty Little Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="s s185">It's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:
those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have
to solve a lot of nasty little ones.</span> <span class="s s186">One of the worst kinds of
projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's
full of bugs.</span> <span class="s s187">Another is when you have to customize
something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.</span>
<span class="s s188">To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand
cuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you
don't learn anything from them.</span> <span class="s s190">Writing a compiler is interesting
because it teaches you what a compiler is.</span> <span class="s s191">But writing an interface
to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the
bugs are random.</span> <span class="s s192">[3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good
hackers avoid nasty little problems. It's more a question of
self-preservation.</span> <span class="s s193">Working on nasty little problems makes you
stupid.</span> <span class="s s194">Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid
cheeseburgers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s195">Of course some problems inherently have this character.</span> <span class="s s196">And because
of supply and demand, they pay especially well.</span> <span class="s s197">So a company that
found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would
be very successful.</span> <span class="s s198">How would you do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s199">One place this happens is in startups.</span> <span class="s s200">At our startup we had 
Robert Morris working as a system administrator.</span> <span class="s s201">That's like having the
Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.</span> <span class="s s202">You can't hire that kind of
talent.</span> <span class="s s203">But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies
of which they're the founders.</span> <span class="s s204">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s205">Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.</span>
<span class="s s206"></span> <span class="s s207">They produce new ideas; maybe
the rest of the company will be able to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s208">You may not have to go to this extreme.</span> 
<span class="s s209">Bottom-up programming
suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people
work as toolmakers.</span> <span class="s s210">If your company makes software to do x, have
one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and
another that uses these tools to write the applications.</span> <span class="s s211">This way
you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,
but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would
be in a traditional research department.</span> <span class="s s212">The toolmakers would have
users, but they'd only be the company's own developers.</span> <span class="s s213">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s214">If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full
of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual
applications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating
memory.</span> <span class="s s215">Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging
together big Lego blocks of Word-language.</span> <span class="s s216">(Duplo, I believe, is
the technical term.</span><span class="s s217">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">Clumping</span></p>
<p><span class="s s219">Along with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other
good hackers.</span> <span class="s s220">Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes
spectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.</span> <span class="s s221">So you won't attract good
hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create
for them.</span> <span class="s s222">The tendency to clump means it's more like the square
of the environment.</span> <span class="s s223">So it's winner take all.</span> <span class="s s224">At any given time,
there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to
work, and if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer
great hackers, you'll have zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s225">Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company
successful.</span> <span class="s s226">It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of
the hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or
Xerox.</span> <span class="s s227">Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model
is a down elevator.</span> <span class="s s228">In that situation, even the best hackers can't
save you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s229">I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that
can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.</span> <span class="s s230">There are
people who would disagree with this.</span> <span class="s s231">When we were making the rounds
of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software
companies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand,
and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s232">They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.</span> <span class="s s233">I
think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,
is the next Microsoft.</span> <span class="s s234">And of course if Microsoft is your model,
you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing
great software.</span> <span class="s s235">But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,
because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other
company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be
the next IBM.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s236">It's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole
culture derives from that one lucky break.</span> <span class="s s237">Microsoft is a bad data
point.</span> <span class="s s238">If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend
to win in the market.</span> <span class="s s239">What VCs should be looking for is the next
Apple, or the next Google.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s240">I think Bill Gates knows this.</span> <span class="s s241">What worries him about Google is
not the power of their brand, but the fact that they have
better hackers.</span> <span class="s s242">[7]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s243">Recognition</span></p>
<p><span class="s s244">So who are the great hackers?</span> <span class="s s245">How do you know when you meet one?</span>
<span class="s s246">That turns out to be very hard.</span> <span class="s s247">Even hackers can't tell.</span> <span class="s s248">I'm
pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.</span>
<span class="s s249">You may have read on Slashdot how he made his 
own Segway.</span> <span class="s s250">The
remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the
software in one day (in Python, incidentally).</span></p>
<p><span class="s s251">For Trevor, that's
par for the course.</span> <span class="s s252">But when I first met him, I thought he was a
complete idiot.</span> <span class="s s253">He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling
at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind
him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his
office so we could go to lunch.</span> <span class="s s254">Robert says he misjudged Trevor
at first too.</span> <span class="s s255">Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had
just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about
every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried
with him everywhere.</span> <span class="s s256">He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had
a strong Canadian accent and a mullet.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s257">The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their
reputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of
effort into seeming smart.</span> <span class="s s258">When I was in grad school I used to
hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally.</span> <span class="s s259">It was kind of intimidating
at first.</span> <span class="s s260">Everyone there spoke so fast.</span> <span class="s s261">But after a while I
learned the trick of speaking fast.</span> <span class="s s262">You don't have to think any
faster; just use twice as many words to say everything.</span> </p>
<p><span class="s s264">With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good
hackers when you meet them.</span> <span class="s s265">I can't tell, even now.</span> <span class="s s266">You also
can't tell from their resumes.</span> <span class="s s267">It seems like the only way to judge
a hacker is to work with him on something.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s268">And this is the reason that high-tech areas 
only happen around universities.</span> <span class="s s269">The active ingredient
here is not so much the professors as the students.</span> <span class="s s270">Startups grow up
around universities because universities bring together promising young
people and make them work on the same projects.</span> <span class="s s271">The
smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together
they cook up new projects of their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s272">Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him,
hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.</span> <span class="s s273">This is true to
a degree in most fields.</span> <span class="s s274">I've found that people who
are great at something are not so much convinced of their own
greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s276">But it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,
because it's hard to compare their work.</span> <span class="s s277">This is easier in most
other fields.</span> <span class="s s278">In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's
fastest.</span> <span class="s s279">Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about
which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good
solution.</span> <span class="s s280">But hacking is like writing.</span> <span class="s s281">Who can say which of two
novels is better?</span> <span class="s s282">Certainly not the authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s283">With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.</span> <span class="s s284">That's because,
unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.</span> <span class="s s285">When you get
to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn
pretty quickly how hard they hit them back.</span> <span class="s s286">But hackers can't
watch themselves at work.</span> <span class="s s287">So if you ask a great hacker how good
he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.</span> <span class="s s288">He's not just
being modest.</span> <span class="s s289">He really doesn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s290">And none of us know, except about people we've actually worked
with.</span> <span class="s s291">Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our
heroes should be.</span> <span class="s s292">The hackers who become famous tend to become
famous by random accidents of PR.</span> <span class="s s293">Occasionally I need to give an
example of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.</span> <span class="s s294">The first
names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,
but it seems lame to use them.</span> <span class="s s295">So, I think, maybe I should say
Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous
like that.</span> <span class="s s296">But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.</span>
<span class="s s297">I've never worked with them on anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s298">If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including
him.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s299">Cultivation</span></p>
<p><span class="s s300">Finally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:
how do you become a great hacker?</span> <span class="s s301">I don't know if it's possible
to make yourself into one.</span> <span class="s s302">But it's certainly possible to do things
that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you
can probably make yourself smart too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s303">The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.</span>
<span class="s s304">When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have
in common is the extreme 
difficulty of making them work 
on anything they
don't want to.</span> <span class="s s305">I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be
both.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s306">To do something well you have to love it.</span> 
<span class="s s307">So to the extent you
can preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it
well.</span> <span class="s s308">Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at
age 14.</span> <span class="s s309">If you're worried that your current job is rotting your
brain, it probably is.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s310">The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in
a lot of fields.</span> <span class="s s311">Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?</span>
<span class="s s312">I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was
curiosity.</span> 
<span class="s s313">I'd always supposed that all smart people were curious--
that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.</span> <span class="s s314">But
apparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how
things work.</span> <span class="s s315">That makes sense, because programs are in effect
giant descriptions of how things work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s316">Several friends mentioned hackers' ability to concentrate-- their
ability, as one put it, to "tune out everything outside their own
heads.</span><span class="s s317">'</span><span class="s s318">' I've certainly noticed this.</span> <span class="s s319">And I've heard several 
hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at
all.</span> <span class="s s320">So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.</span>
<span class="s s321">Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their
head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just
that line but the whole program around it.</span> <span class="s s322">John McPhee
wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due
partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.</span> <span class="s s323">"Perfect'' eyesight
means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.</span> <span class="s s324">Bill Bradley
had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.</span>
<span class="s s325">Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.</span> <span class="s s326">(I cheat by
using a very dense language, 
which shrinks the court.</span><span class="s s327">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s328">This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.</span> <span class="s s329">Maybe the people
in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,
have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having
one's brain in a blender.</span> <span class="s s330">(Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism
are true, knows all too well.</span><span class="s s331">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s332">One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people
in general is that hackers are more 
politically incorrect.</span> <span class="s s333">To the
extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they
know one another well enough to express opinions that would get
them stoned to death by the general public.</span> <span class="s s334">And I can see why
political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.</span>
<span class="s s335">Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good
programmers, very fluid.</span> <span class="s s336">In such situations it's helpful to have
a habit of questioning assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s337">Can you cultivate these qualities?</span> <span class="s s338">I don't know.</span> <span class="s s339">But you can at
least not repress them.</span> <span class="s s340">So here is my best shot at a recipe.</span> <span class="s s341">If
it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do
it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have
to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),
and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.</span>
<span class="s s342">All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though
perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s343">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s344">
[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware. I
wrote this on an IBM laptop.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s345">[2] They did turn out to be doomed. They shut down a few months
later.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s346">[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk
about the "meaning of life.</span><span class="s s347">"</span> <span class="s s348">On the face of it, this seems an 
odd idea.</span> <span class="s s349">Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning?</span>
<span class="s s350">But it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning.</span> <span class="s s351">In a project
like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems
all fall into a pattern, as in a signal.</span> <span class="s s352">Whereas when the problems
you have to solve are random, they seem like noise.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="s s354">[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. (He had equity.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s355">[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the
computer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that
doesn't have users.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s356">I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work
in research departments.</span> <span class="s s357">I think it's mainly not having to have a
three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating
the Korean version of Word 13.</span><span class="s s358">27 with the talking paperclip.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s359">[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the
construction industry.</span> <span class="s s360">When you had a house built a couple hundred
years ago, the local builders built everything in it.</span> <span class="s s361">But increasingly
what builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured
by someone else.</span> <span class="s s362">This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing,
given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it
is certainly more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s363">[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.</span>
<span class="s s364">Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.</span> <span class="s s365">Not
least because they're determined to fight.</span> <span class="s s366">On their job listing
page, they say that one of their "core values'' is "Don't be evil.</span><span class="s s367">'</span><span class="s s368">'
From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a
statement would merely be eccentric.</span> <span class="s s369">But I think all of us in the
computer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.</span></p>
