  <h2><span class="s s1">The Trouble with the Segway</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">July 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">The Segway hasn't delivered on its initial promise, to put it mildly.</span>
<span class="s s4">There are several reasons why, but one is that people don't want
to be seen riding them.</span> <span class="s s5">Someone riding a Segway looks like a dork.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">My friend Trevor Blackwell built 
his own Segway, 
which we called
the Segwell.</span> <span class="s s7">He also built a one-wheeled version, 
the Eunicycle,
which looks exactly like a regular unicycle till you realize the
rider isn't pedaling.</span> <span class="s s8">He has ridden them both to downtown Mountain
View to get coffee.</span> <span class="s s9">When he rides the Eunicycle, people smile at
him.</span> <span class="s s10">But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from their
cars: "Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo?</span><span class="s s11">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">Why do Segways provoke this reaction?</span> <span class="s s13">The reason you look like a
dork riding a Segway is that you look smug.</span> <span class="s s14">You don't seem to
be working hard enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">Someone riding a motorcycle isn't working any harder.</span> <span class="s s16">But because
he's sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort.</span> <span class="s s17">When
you're riding a Segway you're just standing there.</span> <span class="s s18">And someone who's
being whisked along while seeming to do no work&mdash;someone in a sedan
chair, for example&mdash;can't help but look smug.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Try this thought experiment and it becomes clear: imagine something
that worked like the Segway, but that you rode with one foot in
front of the other, like a skateboard.</span> <span class="s s20">That wouldn't seem nearly
as uncool.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">So there may be a way to capture more of the market Segway hoped
to reach: make a version that doesn't look so easy for the rider.</span>
<span class="s s22">It would also be helpful if the styling was in the tradition of
skateboards or bicycles rather than medical devices.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that the
company was itself a kind of Segway.</span> <span class="s s24">It was too easy for them;
they were too successful raising money.</span> <span class="s s25">If they'd had to grow the
company gradually, by iterating through several versions they sold
to real users, they'd have learned pretty quickly that people looked
stupid riding them.</span> <span class="s s26">Instead they had enough to work in secret.</span> <span class="s s27">They
had focus groups aplenty, I'm sure, but they didn't have the people
yelling insults out of cars.</span> <span class="s s28">So they never realized they were
zooming confidently down a blind alley.</span></p>
