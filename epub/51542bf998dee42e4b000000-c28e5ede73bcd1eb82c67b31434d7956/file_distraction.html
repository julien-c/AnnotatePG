  <h2><span class="s s1">Disconnecting Distraction</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">Note: The strategy described at the end of this essay didn't work.</span>
<span class="s s3">It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer.</span> <span class="s s4">I'm trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure
they work before writing about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">May 2008</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Procrastination feeds on distractions. Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.</span>
<span class="s s8">But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are
people working hard to distract you.</span> <span class="s s9">Distraction is not a static
obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.</span>
<span class="s s10">Distraction seeks you out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.</span> <span class="s s12">Distracting
is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.</span> <span class="s s13">And technology is
continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.</span>
<span class="s s14">Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,
new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached
the point where it's like visual crack.</span> <span class="s s16">I realized when I was 13
that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.</span> <span class="s s17">But I read recently
 that the average American watches 
4 hours 
of TV a day.</span> <span class="s s18">A quarter
of their life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more
addictive ways of wasting time.</span> <span class="s s20">And what's especially dangerous
is that many happen at your computer.</span> <span class="s s21">This is no accident.</span> <span class="s s22">An
ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers
connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward
the procrastinators.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s23">I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for
work.</span> <span class="s s24">I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp
files, but most of the time I was offline.</span> <span class="s s25">All I could do was write
and program.</span> <span class="s s26">Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my
desk.</span> <span class="s s27">Terribly addictive things are just a click away.</span> <span class="s s28">Run into
an obstacle in what you're working on?</span> <span class="s s29">Hmm, I wonder what's new
online.</span> <span class="s s30">Better check.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,
and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because
I didn't realize that it evolves.</span> <span class="s s32">Something that used to be safe,
using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.</span> <span class="s s33">Some
days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check
email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then
suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real
work done.</span> <span class="s s34">And this started to happen more and more often.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet
had become, because the problem was intermittent.</span> <span class="s s36">I ignored it the
way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.</span> <span class="s s37">When
I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a
problem.</span> <span class="s s38">It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding
what to do next that they always bit me.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s39">Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type
of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with
it.</span> <span class="s s40">If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,
I'd have noticed very quickly.</span> <span class="s s41">That's a known danger sign, like
drinking alone.</span> <span class="s s42">But using the Internet still looked and felt a 
lot like work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s43">Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much
more distracting that I had to start treating it differently.</span>
<span class="s s44">Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time
sinks: Firefox.</span></p><span class="s s45">&nbsp;* * *&nbsp;</span><p><span class="s s46">The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need
the Internet for some things.</span> <span class="s s47">If you drink too much, you can solve
that problem by stopping entirely.</span> <span class="s s48">But you can't solve the problem
of overeating by stopping eating.</span> <span class="s s49">I couldn't simply avoid the 
Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s50">At first I tried rules.</span> <span class="s s51">For example, I'd tell myself I was only
going to use the Internet twice a day.</span> <span class="s s52">But these schemes never
worked for long.</span> <span class="s s53">Eventually something would come up that required
me to use it more than that.</span> <span class="s s54">And then I'd gradually slip back
into my old ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient
adversaries&mdash;as if there were a little man in your head always
cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're
trying to stop doing.</span> <span class="s s56">If you leave a path to it, he'll find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">The key seems to be visibility.</span> <span class="s s58">The biggest ingredient in most bad habits
is denial.</span> <span class="s s59">So you have to make it so that you can't merely slip
into doing the thing you're trying to avoid.</span> <span class="s s60">It has to set off
alarms.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet
distractions will be 
software that watches and controls them.</span> <span class="s s62">But
in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely
works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need
to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop 
on the other side
of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.</span> <span class="s s64">(Irony of
ironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.</span> <span class="s s65">When
Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I
bought them for the Y Combinator museum.</span><span class="s s66">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long
as I do it on that computer.</span> <span class="s s68">And this turns out to be enough.</span> <span class="s s69">When
I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse
the web, I become much more aware of it.</span> <span class="s s70">Sufficiently aware, in
my case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour
a day online.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">And my main computer is now freed for work.</span> <span class="s s72">If you try this trick,
you'll probably be struck by how different it feels when your
computer is disconnected from the Internet.</span> <span class="s s73">It was alarming to me
how foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could
only be used for work, because that showed how much time I must
have been wasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">Wow. All I can do at this computer is work. Ok, I better work
then.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">That's the good part.</span> <span class="s s76">Your old bad habits now help you to work.</span>
<span class="s s77">You're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a
time.</span> <span class="s s78">But you can't browse the web or check email now.</span> <span class="s s79">What are
you going to do?</span> <span class="s s80">You can't just sit there.</span> <span class="s s81">So you start working.</span></p>
