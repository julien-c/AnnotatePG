  <h2><span class="s s1">Subject: Airbnb</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="s s2">Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable post about missing
Airbnb.</span> <span class="s s3">VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily
rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.</span> <span class="s s4">So
that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is.</span> <span class="s s5">He's
probably the nicest VC I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged
with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.</span>
<span class="s s7">It was quite interesting to read.</span> <span class="s s8">You can see Fred's mind at work 
as he circles the deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish
this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something
that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part
of the conversation).</span> <span class="s s10">It's an interesting illustration of an element
of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:
investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio
companies.</span> <span class="s s11">Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type
are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't
seen it.</span> <span class="s s12">The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the
time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest
in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that
investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.</span>
<span class="s s14">I don't always try as hard as this though.</span> <span class="s s15">Fred must 
have found me quite annoying.</span></p>

is in NYC right now meeting their users.</span> <span class="s s18">(NYC is their biggest
market.</span><span class="s s19">) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to
do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would
never go for it.</span> <span class="s s21">But then I thought maybe I should give you more
credit.</span> <span class="s s22">You'll certainly like meeting them.</span> <span class="s s23">Be sure to ask about
how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay. And this team
is the right one to do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="s s31">It's a longshot, at this stage, but if there was any VC who'd get
you guys, it would be Fred.</span> <span class="s s32">He is the least suburban-golf-playing
VC I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s33">He likes to observe startups for a while before acting, so don't
be bummed if he seems ambivalent.</span></p>

<p><span class="s s55">Ideas can morph.</span> <span class="s s56">Practically every really big startup could say,
five years later, "believe it or not, we started out doing ___.</span><span class="s s57">"</span>
<span class="s s58">It just seemed a very good sign to me that these guys were actually
on the ground in NYC hunting down (and understanding) their users.</span>

their batch by a landslide.</span> <span class="s s67">In the past this has not been a 100%

random.</span></p>

<p><span class="s s75">Did they explain the long-term goal of being the market in accommodation
the way eBay is in stuff?</span> <span class="s s76">That seems like it would be huge.</span> <span class="s s77">Hotels
now are like airlines in the 1970s before they figured out how to
increase their load factors.</span></p>

<p><span class="s s79">They did but I am not sure I buy that</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">ABNB reminds me of Etsy in that it facilitates real commerce in a
marketplace model directly between two people</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">So I think it can scale all the way to the bed and breakfast market</span></p>
<p><span class="s s82">But I am not sure they can take on the hotel market</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">I could be wrong</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">But even so, if you include short term room rental, second home
rental, bed and breakfast, and other similar classes of accommodations,
you get to a pretty big opportunity</span></p>

<p><span class="s s87">So invest in them! They're very capital efficient. They would
make an investor's money go a long way.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">It's also counter-cyclical.</span> <span class="s s89">They just arrived back from NYC, and
when I asked them what was the most significant thing they'd observed,
it was how many of their users actually needed to do these rentals
to pay their rents.</span></p>

<p><span class="s s92">There's a lot to like</span></p>

<p><span class="s s99">I know you're skeptical they'll ever get hotels, but there's a
continuum between private sofas and hotel rooms, and they just moved
one step further along it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s100">[link to an airbnb user]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s101">This is after only a few months.</span> <span class="s s102">I bet you they will get hotels
eventually.</span> <span class="s s103">It will start with small ones.</span> <span class="s s104">Just wait till all the
10-room pensiones in Rome discover this site.</span> <span class="s s105">And once it spreads
to hotels, where is the point (in size of chain) at which it stops?</span>

<p><span class="s s109">That's true. It's also true that there are quite a few marketplaces
out there that serve this same market</span></p>

elsewhere too</span></p>
