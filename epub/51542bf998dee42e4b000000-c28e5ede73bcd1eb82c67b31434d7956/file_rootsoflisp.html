<span class="s s3">(I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly
what McCarthy discovered.</span> <span class="s s4">You don't need to know this stuff
to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to 
anyone who wants to
understand the essence of Lisp-- both in the sense of its
origins and its semantic core.</span> <span class="s s5">The fact that it has such a core
is one of Lisp's distinguishing features, and the reason why,
unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.</span><span class="s s6">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">In 1960, John 
McCarthy published a remarkable paper in
which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for
geometry.</span> <span class="s s8">He showed how, given a handful of simple
operators and a notation for functions, you can
build a whole programming language.</span>
<span class="s s9">He called this language Lisp, for "List Processing,"
because one of his key ideas was to use a simple
data structure called a list for both
code and data.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">It's worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not
just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as
a model for what programming is tending to become in
our own time.</span> <span class="s s11">It seems to me that there have been
two really clean, consistent models of programming so
far: the C model and the Lisp model.</span>
<span class="s s12">These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands
between them.</span> <span class="s s13">As computers have grown more powerful,
the new languages being developed have been moving
steadily toward the Lisp model.</span> <span class="s s14">A popular recipe
for new programming languages in the past 20 years 
has been to take the C model of computing and add to
it, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model,
like runtime typing and garbage collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">In this article I'm going to try to explain in the
simplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered.</span>
<span class="s s16">The point is not just to learn about an interesting
theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago,
but to show where languages are heading.</span>
<span class="s s17">The unusual thing about Lisp-- in fact, the defining
quality of Lisp-- is that it can be written in
itself.</span> <span class="s s18">To understand what McCarthy meant by this,
we're going to retrace his steps, with his mathematical
notation translated into running Common Lisp code.</span></p>
