  <h2><span class="s s1">What Business Can Learn from Open Source</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">August 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2005.)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">Lately companies have been paying more attention to open source.</span>
<span class="s s5">Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its
monopoly to servers.</span> <span class="s s6">It seems safe to say now that open source has
prevented that.</span> <span class="s s7">A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing
Windows servers with Linux servers.</span>
<span class="s s8">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">More significant, I think, is which 52% they are.</span> <span class="s s10">At this point,
anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to
explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon
don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not
about Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them.</span>
<span class="s s12">Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s13">We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating
from open source and blogging.</span> <span class="s s14">As you've probably noticed, they
have a lot in common.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for
free, because they enjoy it.</span> <span class="s s16">Like open source hackers, bloggers
compete with people working for money, and often win.</span> <span class="s s17">The method
of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.</span> <span class="s s18">Companies ensure
quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.</span> <span class="s s19">But
you don't need that when the audience can communicate with one
another.</span> <span class="s s20">People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff
spreads, and the bad gets ignored.</span> <span class="s s21">And in both cases, feedback
from the audience improves the best work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web.</span>
<span class="s s23">People have always been willing to do great work
for free, but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience
or collaborate on projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s24">Amateurs</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is
that people work a lot harder on stuff they like.</span> <span class="s s26">Well, that's
news to no one.</span> <span class="s s27">So how can I claim business has to learn it?</span> <span class="s s28">When
I say business doesn't know this, I mean the structure of business
doesn't reflect it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French
word for working: travailler.</span> <span class="s s30">It has an English cousin, travail,
and what it means is torture.</span>
<span class="s s31">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">This turns out not to be the last word on work, however.</span>
<span class="s s33">As societies get richer, they learn something about
work that's a lot like what they learn about diet.</span> <span class="s s34">We know now that the
healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to
eat because they were poor.</span> <span class="s s35">Like rich food, idleness
only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it.</span> <span class="s s36">I think we were
designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount
of fiber, and we feel bad if we don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">There's a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs.</span>
<span class="s s38">The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology,
though it's staring us in the face.</span> <span class="s s39">"Amateur" was originally rather
a complimentary word.</span> <span class="s s40">But the thing to be in the twentieth century
was professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">That's why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from
open source: that people working for love often surpass those working
for money.</span> <span class="s s42">Users don't switch from Explorer to Firefox because
they want to hack the source.</span> <span class="s s43">They switch because it's a better
browser.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">It's not that Microsoft isn't trying.</span> <span class="s s45">They know controlling the
browser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly.</span> <span class="s s46">The problem
is the same they face in operating systems: they can't pay people
enough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers
will build for free.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the
literal sense of working for money, but also connotations like
formality and detachment.</span> <span class="s s48">Inconceivable as it would have seemed
in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion,
driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">One of the most powerful of those was the existence of "channels.</span><span class="s s50">"</span> <span class="s s51">Revealingly,
the same term was used for both products and information: there
were distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals
seem so superior to amateurs.</span> <span class="s s53">There were only a few jobs as
professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the
average journalist was fairly good.</span> <span class="s s54">Whereas anyone can express
opinions about current events in a bar.</span> <span class="s s55">And so the average person
expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to
a journalist writing about the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower.</span>
<span class="s s57">You don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in.</span>
<span class="s s58">Millions of people are publishing online, and the average
level of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very
good.</span> <span class="s s59">This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don't
present much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">Actually, the fad is the word "blog," at least the way the print
media now use it.</span> <span class="s s61">What they mean by "blogger" is not someone who
publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online.</span>
<span class="s s62">That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default
medium for publication.</span> <span class="s s63">So I'd
like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online.</span>
<span class="s s64">How about "writer?</span><span class="s s65">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s66">Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of
its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads
the average blog.</span> <span class="s s67">In the old world of channels, it meant something
to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting
whether you liked it or not.</span>
<span class="s s68">But now you can read any writer you want.</span> <span class="s s69">So the average
quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing
against.</span> <span class="s s70">They're competing against the best writing online.</span> <span class="s s71">And, 
like Microsoft, they're losing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s72">I know that from my own experience as a reader.</span> <span class="s s73">Though most print
publications are online, I probably
read two or three articles on individual people's sites for every
one I read on the site of a newspaper or magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach
them through the Times front page.</span> <span class="s s75">Most I find through aggregators
like Google News or Slashdot or Delicious.</span> <span class="s s76">Aggregators show how
much better 
you can do than the channel.</span> <span class="s s77">The New York Times front page is
a list of articles written by people who work for the New York Times.</span> <span class="s s78">Delicious
is a list of articles that are interesting.</span> <span class="s s79">And it's only now that
you can see the two side by side that you notice how little overlap there is.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">Most articles in the print media are boring.</span> <span class="s s81">For example, the
president notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq
was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up
support.</span> <span class="s s82">Where is the man bites dog in that?</span> <span class="s s83">I didn't hear the
speech, but I could probably tell you exactly what he said.</span> <span class="s s84">A
speech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is
nothing new in it.</span>
<span class="s s85">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most
"news" about things going wrong.</span> <span class="s s87">A child is abducted; there's a
tornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a small
plane crashes.</span> <span class="s s88">And what do you learn about the world from these
stories?</span> <span class="s s89">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span class="s s90">They're outlying data points; what
makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it's not
surprising if amateurs can do better.</span> <span class="s s92">Live by the channel, die by
the channel: if you depend on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habits
that are hard to overcome when you suddenly get competition.</span>
<span class="s s93">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">Workplaces</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">Another thing blogs and open source software have in common is that
they're often made by people working at home.</span> <span class="s s96">That may not seem
surprising.</span> <span class="s s97">But it should be.</span> <span class="s s98">It's the architectural equivalent
of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.</span> <span class="s s99">Companies spend
millions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a
place to work.</span> <span class="s s100">And yet people working in their own homes,
which aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up
being more productive.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s101">This proves something a lot of us have suspected.</span> <span class="s s102">The average
office is a miserable place to get work done.</span> <span class="s s103">And a lot of what
makes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with
professionalism.</span> <span class="s s104">The sterility
of offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.</span> <span class="s s105">But suggesting
efficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what
flames painted on the side of a car are to speed.</span> <span class="s s107">And it's not
just the way offices look that's bleak.</span> <span class="s s108">The way people act is just
as bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">Things are different in a startup.</span> <span class="s s110">Often as not a startup begins
in an apartment.</span> <span class="s s111">Instead of matching beige cubicles
they have an assortment of furniture they bought used.</span> <span class="s s112">They work
odd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.</span> <span class="s s113">They look at
whatever they want online without worrying whether it's "work safe.</span><span class="s s114">"</span>
<span class="s s115">The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.</span> <span class="s s116">And
you know what?</span> <span class="s s117">The company at this stage is probably the most
productive it's ever going to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">Maybe it's not a coincidence. Maybe some aspects of professionalism
are actually a net lose.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is
that you're supposed to be there at certain times.</span> <span class="s s120">There are usually
a few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most
employees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their
productivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s121">The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people
work, you can at least prevent them from having fun.</span> <span class="s s122">If employees
have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are
forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be
working.</span> <span class="s s123">In theory.</span> <span class="s s124">In practice they spend a lot of their time
in a no-man's land, where they're neither working nor having fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">If you could measure how much work people did, many companies
wouldn't need any fixed workday.</span> <span class="s s126">You could just say: this is what
you have to do.</span> <span class="s s127">Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.</span> <span class="s s128">If
your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then
you may need to be here a certain amount.</span> <span class="s s129">Otherwise we don't care.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s130">That may seem utopian, but it's what we told people who came to
work for our company.</span> <span class="s s131">There were no fixed office hours.</span> <span class="s s132">I never
showed up before 11 in the morning.</span> <span class="s s133">But we weren't saying this to
be benevolent.</span> <span class="s s134">We were saying: if you work here we expect you to
get a lot done.</span> <span class="s s135">Don't try to fool us just by being here a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s136">The problem with the facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but
that the people pretending to work interrupt
the ones actually working.</span> <span class="s s137">I'm convinced the facetime model
is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings.</span>
<span class="s s138">Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little.</span>
<span class="s s139">And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a
day.</span> <span class="s s140">When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement
comes out the other, something has to give.</span> <span class="s s141">And meetings are the
main mechanism for taking up the slack.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">For one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember
well the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings.</span>
<span class="s s143">I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for
programming.</span> <span class="s s144">It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on
my desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter
what I did.</span> <span class="s s145">Even while I was in the bathroom!</span> <span class="s s146">But because the
imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be
working.</span> <span class="s s147">And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.</span> <span class="s s148">They
counted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier.</span>
<span class="s s149">All you had to do was sit and look attentive.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s150">Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect.</span> <span class="s s151">So is email,
on a smaller scale.</span> <span class="s s152">And in addition to the direct cost in time,
there's the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people's day up into
bits too small to be useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">You can see how dependent you've become on something by removing
it suddenly.</span> <span class="s s154">So for big companies I propose the following experiment.</span>
<span class="s s155">Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has to
sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on
things they can do without talking to anyone else.</span>
<span class="s s156">Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I'm
sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could
do by themselves.</span> <span class="s s157">You could call it "Work Day.</span><span class="s s158">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s159">The other problem with pretend work
is that it often looks better than real work.</span> <span class="s s160">When I'm
writing or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do
actually typing.</span> <span class="s s161">Half the time I'm sitting drinking a cup of tea,
or walking around the neighborhood.</span> <span class="s s162">This is a critical phase--
this is where ideas come from-- and yet I'd feel guilty doing this
in most offices, with everyone else looking busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s163">It's hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something
to compare it to.</span> <span class="s s164">And that's one reason open source, and even blogging
in some cases, are so important.</span> <span class="s s165">They show us what real work looks like.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s166">We're funding eight new startups at the moment.</span> <span class="s s167">A friend asked
what they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when I
said we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found
to live in.</span> <span class="s s168">But we didn't propose that to save money.</span> <span class="s s169">We did it
because we want their software to be good.</span> <span class="s s170">Working in crappy
informal spaces is one of the things startups do right without
realizing it.</span> <span class="s s171">As soon as you get into an office, work and life
start to drift apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">That is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and life
are supposed to be separate. But that part, I'm convinced, is a 
mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s173">Bottom-Up</span></p>
<p><span class="s s174">The third big lesson we can learn from open source and
blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of
flowing down from the top.</span> <span class="s s175">Open source and blogging both work
bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff
prevails.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s176">Does this sound familiar?</span> <span class="s s177">It's the principle of a market economy.</span>
<span class="s s178">Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those
worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all
their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like
communist states.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s179">There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about
what to do next, and the enforcement of quality.</span> <span class="s s180">In the channel
era, both flowed down from the top.</span> <span class="s s181">For example, newspaper editors
assigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s182">Open source and blogging show us things don't have to work that
way.</span> <span class="s s183">Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up.</span>
<span class="s s184">And in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better.</span>
<span class="s s185">For example, open source software is more reliable precisely because
it's open source; anyone can find mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s186">The same happens with writing.</span> <span class="s s187">As we got close to publication, I
found I was very worried about the essays in 
Hackers
&amp; Painters
that hadn't been online.</span> <span class="s s188">Once an essay has had a couple thousand
page views I feel reasonably confident about it.</span> <span class="s s189">But these had had 
literally orders of magnitude less scrutiny.</span> <span class="s s190">It felt like
releasing software without testing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s191">That's what all publishing used to be like.</span> <span class="s s192">If
you got ten people to read a manuscript, you were lucky.</span> <span class="s s193">But I'd
become so used to publishing online that the old method now seemed
alarmingly unreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you'd
gotten used to a GPS.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s194">The other thing I like about publishing online is that you can write
what you want and publish when you want.</span> <span class="s s195">Earlier this year I wrote
something that seemed suitable for a magazine, so
I sent it to an editor I know.</span>
<span class="s s196">As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was
hoping they'd reject it.</span> <span class="s s197">Then I could put it online right away.</span>
<span class="s s198">If they accepted it, it wouldn't be read by anyone for months, and
in the meantime I'd have to fight word-by-word to save it from being
mangled by some twenty five year old copy editor.</span>
<span class="s s199">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s200">Many employees would like to build great things for the companies
they work for, but more often than not management won't let them.</span>
<span class="s s201">How many of us have heard stories of employees going to management
and saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you--
and the company saying no?</span> <span class="s s202">The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak,
who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP.</span>
<span class="s s203">And they turned him down.</span> <span class="s s204">On the blunderometer, this episode ranks
with IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.</span> <span class="s s205">But I think this
happens all the time.</span> <span class="s s206">We just don't hear about it usually,
because to prove yourself right you have to quit
and start your own company, like Wozniak did.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s207">Startups</span></p>
<p><span class="s s208">So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging
have to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff they
like, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive,
and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s209">I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talking
about?</span> <span class="s s210">What good does it do me to know that my programmers
would be more productive
working at home on their own projects?</span> <span class="s s211">I need their asses in here
working on version 3.</span><span class="s s212">2 of our software, or we're never going to
make the release date.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">And it's true, the benefit that specific manager could derive from
the forces I've described is near zero.</span> <span class="s s214">When I say business can
learn from open source, I don't mean any specific business can.</span> <span class="s s215">I
mean business can learn about new conditions the same way a gene
pool does.</span> <span class="s s216">I'm not claiming companies can get smarter, just that
dumb ones will die.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s217">So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons
of open source and blogging?</span> <span class="s s218">I think the big obstacle preventing
us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people
working for you have to be employees.</span> <span class="s s219">But think about what's going
on underneath: the company has some money, and they pay it to the
employee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they
paid him.</span> <span class="s s220">Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship.</span>
<span class="s s221">Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him
as investment?</span> <span class="s s222">Then instead of coming to your office to work on
your projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s223">Because few of us know any alternative, we have no idea how much
better we could do than the traditional employer-employee relationship.</span>
<span class="s s224">Such customs evolve with glacial slowness.</span> <span class="s s225">Our 
employer-employee relationship still retains a big chunk of
master-servant DNA.</span>
<span class="s s226">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s227">I dislike being on either end of it.</span>
<span class="s s228">I'll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told what
to do by a boss.</span> <span class="s s229">And being a boss is also horribly frustrating; 
half the time it's easier just to do stuff yourself than to get
someone else to do it for you.</span>
<span class="s s230">I'd rather do almost anything than give or receive a
performance review.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s231">On top of its unpromising origins, employment
has accumulated a lot of cruft over the years.</span> <span class="s s232">The list of what
you can't ask in job interviews is now so long that for convenience
I assume it's infinite.</span> <span class="s s233">Within the
office you now have to walk on eggshells lest anyone 
say or do
something that makes the company prey to a lawsuit.</span> <span class="s s234">And God help
you if you fire anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s235">Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economic
relationship than companies being sued for firing people.</span> <span class="s s236">In any
purely economic relationship you're free to do what you want.</span> <span class="s s237">If
you want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and start
buying it from another, you don't have to explain why.</span> <span class="s s238">No one can
accuse you of unjustly switching pipe suppliers.</span> <span class="s s239">Justice implies
some kind of paternal obligation that isn't there in
transactions between equals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s240">Most of the legal restrictions on employers are intended to protect
employees.</span> <span class="s s241">But you can't have action without an equal and opposite
reaction.</span> <span class="s s242">You can't expect employers to have some kind of paternal
responsibility toward employees without putting employees in the
position of children.</span> <span class="s s243">And that seems a bad road to go down.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s244">Next time you're in a moderately large city, drop by the main post
office and watch the body language of the people working there.</span>
<span class="s s245">They have the same sullen resentment as children made to do
something they don't want to.</span> <span class="s s246">Their union has exacted pay
increases and work restrictions that would have been the envy of
previous generations of postal workers, and yet they don't seem any
happier for it.</span> <span class="s s247">It's demoralizing
to be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, no
matter how cozy the terms. Just ask any teenager.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s248">I see the disadvantages of the employer-employee relationship because
I've been on both sides of a better one: the investor-founder relationship.</span>
<span class="s s249">I wouldn't claim it's painless.</span> <span class="s s250">When I was running a
startup, the thought of our investors used to keep me up at night.</span>
<span class="s s251">And now that I'm an investor,
the thought of our startups keeps me
up at night.</span> <span class="s s252">All the pain of whatever problem you're trying to
solve is still there.</span>
<span class="s s253">But the pain hurts less when it isn't
mixed with resentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s254">I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlled
experiment to prove that.</span> <span class="s s255">After Yahoo bought our startup I went
to work for them.</span> <span class="s s256">I was doing exactly the same work, except with
bosses.</span> <span class="s s257">And to my horror I started acting like a child.</span> <span class="s s258">The 
situation pushed buttons I'd forgotten
I had.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s259">The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open
source and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of
their own are enormously more productive.</span> <span class="s s260">And a
startup is a project
of one's own in two senses, both of them important: it's creatively
one's own, and also economically ones's own.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s261">Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forces
I've described.</span> <span class="s s262">They've tried hard to make their offices less sterile
than the usual cube farm.</span> <span class="s s263">They give employees who do great work
large grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup.</span> <span class="s s264">They
even let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s265">Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects,
and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create,
give them the actual market value?</span> <span class="s s266">Impossible?</span> <span class="s s267">That is in fact
what venture capitalists do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s268">So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore--
that everyone should go and start a startup?</span> <span class="s s269">Of course not.</span>
<span class="s s270">But more people could do it than do it now.</span>
<span class="s s271">At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking
they have to get a job.</span> 
<span class="s s272">Actually what they need to do is make
something valuable.</span> <span class="s s273">A job is one way to do that, but the more
ambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an
investor than an employer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s274">Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.</span> <span class="s s275">But business
administration is not what you're doing in a startup.</span> <span class="s s276">What you're
doing is business creation.</span> <span class="s s277">And the first phase of that
is mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.</span> <span class="s s278">That's the
hard part.</span> <span class="s s279">It's a lot harder to create something people love than
to take something people love and figure out how to make money from
it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s280">Another thing that keeps people away from starting startups is the
risk.</span> <span class="s s281">Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice before
doing it.</span> <span class="s s282">But most young hackers have neither.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s283">And as the example of open source and blogging suggests, you'll
enjoy it more, even if you fail.</span> <span class="s s284">You'll be working on your own
thing, instead of going to some office and doing what you're told.</span>
<span class="s s285">There may be more pain in your own company, but it won't hurt as
much.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s286">That may be the greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces 
underlying open source and blogging: finally ditching the old
paternalistic employer-employee relationship, and replacing it with
a purely economic one, between equals.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s287">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s288">[1]
Survey by Forrester Research reported in the cover story of
Business Week, 31 Jan 2005.</span> <span class="s s289">Apparently someone believed you have to
replace the actual server in order to switch the operating system.</span></p>

It derives from the late Latin tripalium,
a torture device so called because it consisted of three stakes.</span>
<span class="s s291">I don't know how the stakes were used.</span> <span class="s s292">"Travel" has the same root.</span></p>

It would be much bigger news, in that sense, if the president
faced unscripted questions by giving a press conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s294">[4]
One measure of the incompetence of newspapers is that so many
still make you register to read stories.</span> <span class="s s295">I have yet to find a blog
that tried that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s296">[5]
They accepted the article, but I took so long to
send them the final version that by the time I did the section of
the magazine they'd accepted it for had disappeared in a reorganization.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s297">[6]
The word "boss" is derived from the Dutch baas, meaning
"master."</span></p>
