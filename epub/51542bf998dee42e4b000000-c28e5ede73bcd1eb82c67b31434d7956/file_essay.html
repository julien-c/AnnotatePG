  <h2><span class="s s1">The Age of the Essay</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">September 2004</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Remember the essays you had to write in high school?</span>
<span class="s s4">Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.</span> <span class="s s5">The conclusion being,
say, that Ahab in Moby Dick was a Christ-like figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">Oy. So I'm going to try to give the other side of the
story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.
Or at least, how I write one.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s7">Mods</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.</span>
<span class="s s9">Certainly schools should teach students how to
write.</span> <span class="s s10">But due to a series of historical accidents
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.</span> <span class="s s11">And so all over the country students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">With the result that writing is made to seem boring and
pointless.</span> <span class="s s13">Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?</span>
<span class="s s14">Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s15">How did things get this way?</span> <span class="s s16">To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.</span> <span class="s s17">Around 1100, Europe at last began to
catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they
had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered
what we call "the classics.</span><span class="s s18">"</span> <span class="s s19">The effect was rather as if
we were visited by beings from another solar system.</span>
<span class="s s20">These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated
that for the next several centuries the main work of
European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate
what they knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great
prestige.</span> <span class="s s22">It seemed the essence of what scholars did.</span> <span class="s s23">As
European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;
by 1350
someone who wanted to learn about science could find better
teachers than Aristotle in his own era.</span> <span class="s s24">[1]
But schools change slower than scholarship.</span> <span class="s s25">In the
19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone
of the curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s26">The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?</span> <span class="s s27">The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.</span>
<span class="s s28">But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.</span>
<span class="s s29">The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
those studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s30">And so began the study of modern literature.</span> <span class="s s31">There was a good
deal of resistance at first.</span>
<span class="s s32">The first courses in English literature
seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly
American ones.</span> <span class="s s33">Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst,
and University College, London
taught English literature in the 1820s.</span>

<span class="s s34">But Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature until
1876, and Oxford not till 1885.</span> <span class="s s35">(Oxford had a chair of Chinese before
it had one of English.</span><span class="s s36">) [2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have
been the idea that professors should do research as well
as teach.</span> <span class="s s38">This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and
indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported
from Germany in the late 19th century.</span> <span class="s s39">Beginning at
Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">Writing was one of the casualties.</span> <span class="s s41">Colleges had long taught
English composition.</span> <span class="s s42">But how do you do research on composition?</span>
<span class="s s43">The professors who taught math could be required to do original
math, the professors who taught history could be required to
write scholarly articles about history, but what about the 
professors who taught rhetoric or composition?</span> <span class="s s44">What should they
do research on?</span> <span class="s s45">The closest thing seemed to be English literature.</span> <span class="s s46">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited
by English professors.</span> <span class="s s48">This had two drawbacks:
(a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer,
any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b)
the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that's
what the professor is interested in.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">High schools imitate universities.</span> <span class="s s50">The seeds of our miserable
high school experiences were sown in 1892, when
the National Education Association
"formally recommended that literature
and composition be unified in the high school course.</span><span class="s s51">"</span> <span class="s s52">[4]
The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English,
with the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a 
few decades before.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s53">It's no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">No Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">The other big difference between a real essay and the things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't
take a position and then defend it.</span> <span class="s s56">That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">It's often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.</span> <span class="s s58">In fact they
were more law schools.</span> <span class="s s59">And at least in our tradition
lawyers are advocates, trained to take
either side of an argument and make as good a case for it
as they can.</span>
<span class="s s60">Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded
early universities.</span> <span class="s s61">The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing
persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum.</span> <span class="s s62">[5]
And after the lecture the most common form
of discussion was the disputation.</span> <span class="s s63">This is at least
nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:
most people treat the words thesis
and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,
a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a
legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.</span> <span class="s s65">It's not
just that you miss subtleties this way.</span>
<span class="s s66">The real problem is that you can't change the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">And yet this principle is built into the very structure of
the things they teach you to write in high school.</span> <span class="s s68">The topic 
sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting
paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
conclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion?</span> <span class="s s69">I was never sure
about that in high school.</span> <span class="s s70">It seemed as if we were just
supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,
but in different enough words that no one could tell.</span>
<span class="s s71">Why bother?</span>
<span class="s s72">But when you understand the origins
of this sort of "essay," you can see where the
conclusion comes from.</span> <span class="s s73">It's the concluding remarks to the 
jury.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it
should be convincing because you got the right answers,
not because you did a good job of arguing.</span> <span class="s s75">When I give a 
draft of an essay to friends, there are two things
I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem 
unconvincing.</span> <span class="s s76">The boring bits can usually be fixed by 
cutting.</span> <span class="s s77">But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by
arguing more cleverly.</span> <span class="s s78">I need to talk the matter over.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">At the very least I must have explained something badly.</span> <span class="s s80">In
that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced
to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just
incorporate in the essay.</span> <span class="s s81">More often than not I have
to change what I was saying as well.</span>
<span class="s s82">But the aim is never to be convincing per se.</span>
<span class="s s83">As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical,
so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be
a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it's historically
inaccurate to call it an essay.</span> <span class="s s85">An essay is 
something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">Trying</span></p>
<p><span class="s s87">To understand what a real essay is, we have to
reach back into history again, though this time not so far.</span>
<span class="s s88">To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of
what he called "essais.</span><span class="s s89">"</span> <span class="s s90">He was
doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and
the difference is embodied in the name.</span> <span class="s s91">Essayer is the French
verb meaning "to try"
and an essai is an attempt.</span> <span class="s s92">An essay is something you
write to try to figure something out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">Figure out what?</span> <span class="s s94">You don't know yet.</span> <span class="s s95">And so you can't begin with a
thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have
one.</span> <span class="s s96">An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a
question.</span> <span class="s s97">In a real essay, you don't take a position and
defend it.</span> <span class="s s98">You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and
walk in to see what's inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need
to write anything, though?</span> <span class="s s100">Why not just sit and think?</span> <span class="s s101">Well,
there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.</span> <span class="s s102">Expressing 
ideas helps to form them.</span> <span class="s s103">Indeed, helps is far too weak a
word.</span> <span class="s s104">Most of what ends up in my essays I only
thought of when I sat down to write them.</span> <span class="s s105">That's why I 
write them.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">In the things you write in school you are, in theory,
merely explaining yourself to the reader.</span>
<span class="s s107">In a real essay you're writing for yourself.</span>
<span class="s s108">You're thinking out loud.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">But not quite.</span>
<span class="s s110">Just as inviting people over forces you to
clean up your apartment, writing something that
other people will read forces you to think well.</span> <span class="s s111">So it
does matter to have an audience.</span> <span class="s s112">The things I've written
just for myself are no good.</span>
<span class="s s113">They tend to peter out.</span> <span class="s s114">When I run into
difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague
questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s115">Many published essays peter out in the same way.</span>
<span class="s s116">Particularly the sort written by the staff writers 
of newsmagazines.</span> <span class="s s117">Outside writers tend to supply
editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
make a beeline toward a rousing (and
foreordained) conclusion.</span> <span class="s s118">But the staff writers feel
obliged to write something "balanced.</span><span class="s s119">"</span>
<span class="s s120">Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the
most radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because
they're writing for a popular magazine-- they
then proceed to recoil in terror.</span>
<span class="s s121">Abortion, for or against?</span>
<span class="s s122">This group says one thing.</span> <span class="s s123">That group says
another.</span> <span class="s s124">One thing is certain: the question is a
complex one.</span> <span class="s s125">(But don't get mad at us.</span> <span class="s s126">We didn't
draw any conclusions.</span><span class="s s127">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s128">The River</span></p>
<p><span class="s s129">Questions aren't enough.</span> <span class="s s130">An essay has to come up with answers.</span>
<span class="s s131">They don't always, of course.</span> <span class="s s132">Sometimes you start with a
promising question and get nowhere.</span> <span class="s s133">But those you don't 
publish.</span> <span class="s s134">Those are like experiments that get inconclusive
results.</span> <span class="s s135">An essay you publish ought to tell the reader 
something he didn't already know.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s136">But what you tell him doesn't matter, so long as 
it's interesting.</span> <span class="s s137">I'm sometimes accused of meandering.</span>
<span class="s s138">In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.</span>
<span class="s s139">There you're not concerned with truth.</span> <span class="s s140">You already
know where you're going, and you want to go straight there,
blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
your way across swampy ground.</span> <span class="s s141">But that's not what
you're trying to do in an essay.</span> <span class="s s142">An essay is supposed to
be a search for truth.</span> <span class="s s143">It would be suspicious if it didn't
meander.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey.</span>
<span class="s s145">As you might expect, it winds all over the place.</span>
<span class="s s146">But it doesn't do this out of frivolity.</span>
<span class="s s147">The path it has discovered is the most
economical route to the sea.</span> <span class="s s148">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s149">The river's algorithm is simple.</span> <span class="s s150">At each step, flow down.</span>
<span class="s s151">For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.</span> 
<span class="s s152">Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.</span>
<span class="s s153">One can't have quite as little foresight as a river.</span> <span class="s s154">I always
know generally what I want to write about.</span>
<span class="s s155">But not the
specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to
paragraph I let the ideas take their course.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s156">This doesn't always work.</span> <span class="s s157">Sometimes, like a river,
one runs up against a wall.</span> <span class="s s158">Then I do the same thing the river does:
backtrack.</span> <span class="s s159">At one point in this essay
I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
of ideas.</span> <span class="s s160">I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over
in another direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s161">Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up
train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.</span>
<span class="s s162">Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts.</span>
<span class="s s163">It would be exhausting to read.</span> <span class="s s164">You need to 
cut and fill to
emphasize the central thread, like an
illustrator inking over a pencil drawing.</span> <span class="s s165">But don't
change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s166">Err on the side of the river.</span> <span class="s s167">An essay is not a reference
work.</span> <span class="s s168">It's not something you read looking for a specific
answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.</span> <span class="s s169">I'd much
rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along
a prescribed course.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s170">Surprise</span></p>
<p><span class="s s171">So what's interesting?</span> <span class="s s172">For me, interesting means surprise.</span>
<span class="s s173">Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of
least astonishment.</span> <span class="s s174">A button that looks like it will make a
machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.</span> <span class="s s175">Essays 
should do the opposite.</span> <span class="s s176">Essays should aim for maximum
surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s177">I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel
vicariously.</span> <span class="s s178">When friends came back from faraway places,
it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked
what they saw.</span> <span class="s s179">I really wanted to know.</span> <span class="s s180">And I found
the best way to get information out of them was to ask
what surprised them.</span> <span class="s s181">How was the place different from what
they expected?</span> <span class="s s182">This is an extremely useful question.</span>
<span class="s s183">You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will 
extract information they didn't even know they were
recording.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s184">Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that
contradict things you
thought you knew.</span> <span class="s s185">And so they're the most valuable sort of
fact you can get.</span> <span class="s s186">They're like a food that's not merely
healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
you've already eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s187">How do you find surprises?</span> <span class="s s188">Well, therein lies half
the work of essay writing.</span> <span class="s s189">(The other half is expressing
yourself well.</span><span class="s s190">) The trick is to use yourself as a
proxy for the reader.</span> <span class="s s191">You should only write about things
you've thought about a lot.</span> <span class="s s192">And anything you come across
that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot,
will probably surprise most readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s193">For example, in a recent 
essay I pointed out that because
you can only judge computer programmers by working with
them, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.</span>
<span class="s s194">I didn't realize this when I began
that essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.</span> <span class="s s195">That's
what you're looking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s196">So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:
a few topics you've thought about a lot, and
some ability to ferret out the unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s197">What should you think about?</span> <span class="s s198">My guess is that it
doesn't matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeply
enough into it.</span> <span class="s s199">One possible exception might be things
that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them,
like working in fast food.</span> <span class="s s200">In retrospect, was there
anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?</span>
<span class="s s201">Well, it was interesting how important color was
to the customers.</span> <span class="s s202">Kids a certain age would point into
the case and say that they wanted yellow.</span> <span class="s s203">Did they want 
French Vanilla or Lemon?</span> <span class="s s204">They would just look at you 
blankly.</span> <span class="s s205">They wanted yellow.</span> <span class="s s206">And then there was the 
mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream 
was so appealing.</span> <span class="s s207">(I think now it was the salt.</span><span class="s s208">)

And the difference in the way fathers and
mothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers
like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers
harried, giving in to pressure.</span>
<span class="s s209">So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in
fast food.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s210">I didn't notice those things at the time, though.</span> <span class="s s211">At sixteen
I was about as observant as a lump of rock.</span> <span class="s s212">I can see more now in
the fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could see
at the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s213">Observation</span></p>
<p><span class="s s214">So the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be an
inborn one. It must be something you can learn.
How do you learn it?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s215">To some extent it's like learning history.</span>
<span class="s s216">When you first read
history, it's just a whirl of names
and dates.</span> 
<span class="s s217">Nothing seems to stick.</span> <span class="s s218">But the more you learn, the more hooks you have
for new facts to stick onto-- which means
you accumulate knowledge at what's colloquially called an
exponential rate.</span> <span class="s s219">Once you
remember that Normans conquered
England in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hear
that other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time.</span>
<span class="s s220">Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note
when a third book mentions that Normans
were not, like most of what is now
called France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed,
but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived
four centuries later in 911.</span> <span class="s s221">Which makes
it easier to remember that Dublin was also established by
Vikings in the 840s.</span> <span class="s s222">Etc, etc squared.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s223">Collecting surprises is a similar process.</span>
<span class="s s224">The more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice
new ones.</span> <span class="s s225">Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older,
life should become more and more surprising.</span> <span class="s s226">When I was a
kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.</span>
<span class="s s227">I had it backwards.</span> <span class="s s228">Kids are the ones who have it all figured 
out.</span> <span class="s s229">They're just mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s230">When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer.</span> <span class="s s231">But
(as with wealth) there
may be habits of mind that will help the process along.</span> <span class="s s232">It's
good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions
beginning with Why.</span>
<span class="s s233">But not in the random way that three year
olds ask why.</span> <span class="s s234">There are an infinite number of questions.</span>
<span class="s s235">How do you find the fruitful ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s236">I find it especially
useful to ask why about things that seem wrong.</span>
<span class="s s237">For example, why should there be a connection between
humor and misfortune?</span> <span class="s s238">Why do we find it funny when a
character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?</span>
<span class="s s239">There's a whole essay's worth of surprises there for sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s240">If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a
degree of skepticism helpful.</span> <span class="s s241">I take it as an axiom
that we're only achieving 1% of what we could.</span>
<span class="s s242">This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our
heads as children: that things are the way they are because
that is how things have to be.</span>
<span class="s s243">For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay 
felt the same about
English classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.</span>
<span class="s s244">But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize that
it was, in fact, all a mistake.</span>
<span class="s s245">We all thought there was just something we weren't getting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s246">I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things
that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way.</span> 
<span class="s s247">I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they
read a draft of an essay.</span> <span class="s s248">But why should I be?</span> <span class="s s249">I'm aiming
for good ideas.</span> <span class="s s250">Why should good ideas be funny?</span>
<span class="s s251">The connection may be surprise.</span>
<span class="s s252">Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what
one wants to deliver.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s253">I write down things that surprise me in notebooks.</span> <span class="s s254">I never
actually get around to reading them and using
what I've written, but I do tend to
reproduce the same thoughts later.</span> <span class="s s255">So the main value
of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your
head.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s256">People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage
when collecting surprises.</span> <span class="s s257">To be surprised is to be mistaken.</span>
<span class="s s258">And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell
you, is nil admirari.</span> <span class="s s259">When you're mistaken, don't
dwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no one
will notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s260">One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where
inexperience may make you look foolish.</span> 
<span class="s s261">If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.</span>
<span class="s s262">Study lots of different things,
because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected
connections between different fields.</span> <span class="s s263">For example, 
jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing
of foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation.</span>
<span class="s s264">And so were books and paintings.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s265">Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic
history, not political history.</span> <span class="s s266">History seems to me so important
that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.</span>
<span class="s s267">Another way to describe it is all the data we have so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s268">Among other things, studying history gives one confidence that
there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses.</span>
<span class="s s269">Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which
(like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from the
blade.</span> <span class="s s270">Because swords are longer
the hilts kept breaking off.</span> <span class="s s271">But it took five hundred years
before someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one
piece.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s272">Disobedience</span></p>
<p><span class="s s273">Above all, make a habit of paying
attention to things you're not supposed to, either because 
they're "inappropriate," 
or not important, or not what you're
supposed to be working on.</span> <span class="s s274">If you're curious about something,
trust your instincts.</span>
<span class="s s275">Follow the threads that attract your
attention.</span> <span class="s s276">If there's something you're really interested
in, you'll find they have an uncanny way of leading back to
it anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especially
proud of something always tends to lead back to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s277">For example, I've always been fascinated by comb-overs, especially
the extreme sort that
make a man look as if he's wearing a beret made of his own hair.</span>
<span class="s s278">Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- the
sort of superficial quizzing
best left to teenage girls.</span> <span class="s s279">And yet there is something underneath.</span>
<span class="s s280">The key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over not
see how odd he looks?</span>
<span class="s s281">And the answer is that he got to look that way incrementally.</span>
<span class="s s282">What began as combing his hair a little carefully over a
thin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity.</span>
<span class="s s283">Gradualness is very powerful.</span> <span class="s s284">And that power can be
used for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick
yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into
creating something so grand that you would never have dared to
plan such a thing.</span> <span class="s s285">Indeed, this is just how most good
software gets created.</span> <span class="s s286">You start by writing a stripped-down
kernel (how hard can it be?</span><span class="s s287">) and gradually it grows
into a complete operating system.</span> <span class="s s288">Hence the next leap: could
you do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s289">See what you can extract from a frivolous question?</span>
<span class="s s290">If there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays,
it would be: don't do as you're told.</span>
<span class="s s291">Don't believe what you're supposed to.</span>
<span class="s s292">Don't write the
essay readers expect; one learns nothing from
what one expects.</span>
<span class="s s293">And
don't write the way they taught you to in school.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s294">The most important sort of disobedience is to write
essays at all.</span> <span class="s s295">Fortunately, this sort of disobedience shows
signs of becoming 
rampant.</span> 
<span class="s s296">It used to be that only a tiny
number of officially approved writers were allowed to
write essays.</span> <span class="s s297">Magazines published few of them, and judged
them less by what they said than who wrote them;
a magazine might publish a story by an
unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published
an essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least
forty and whose job title had x in it.</span> <span class="s s298">Which is a problem,
because there are a lot of things insiders can't say precisely
because they're insiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s299">The Internet is changing that.</span>
<span class="s s300">Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any
writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it.</span>
<span class="s s301">Who are you to write about x?</span> <span class="s s302">You are whatever you wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s303">Popular magazines made the period between the spread
of literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the
short story.</span>
<span class="s s304">The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.</span>
<span class="s s305">And that's certainly not something I realized when
I started writing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s306">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s307">[1] I'm thinking of Oresme (c.</span> <span class="s s308">1323-82).</span> <span class="s s309">But it's hard to pick
a date, because there was a sudden drop-off in scholarship
just as Europeans finished assimilating classical science.</span>
<span class="s s310">The cause may have been the plague of 1347; the trend in
scientific progress matches the population curve.</span></p>

<span class="s s328">At first
literature took a back seat to philology, which (a) seemed more 
serious and (b) was popular in Germany, where many of the
leading scholars of that generation had been trained.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s329">In some cases the writing teachers were transformed
in situ into English professors.</span>
<span class="s s330">Francis James Child, who had been Boylston Professor
of Rhetoric at Harvard since 1851,

<p><span class="s s331">[4] Parker, op. cit., p. 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s332">[5] The undergraduate curriculum or trivium (whence
"trivial") consisted of Latin grammar, rhetoric, and logic.</span> 
<span class="s s333">Candidates for masters' degrees went on to study the

<span class="s s334">Together these were the seven liberal arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s335">The study of rhetoric was inherited directly from Rome, where
it was considered the most important
subject.</span> <span class="s s336">It would not be far from the truth to say that

meant training landowners' sons
to speak well enough to defend their interests
in political and legal disputes.</span></p>
