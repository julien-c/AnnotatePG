<p><span class="s s3">For nearly all of history the success of a society was proportionate
to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.</span>
<span class="s s4">Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the
largest organizations were the most successful ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to
believe, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations
tended to be the most progressive.</span> <span class="s s6">An ambitious kid graduating
from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices
of Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.</span> <span class="s s7">Small meant small-time.</span>
<span class="s s8">Small in 1960 didn't mean a cool little startup.</span> <span class="s s9">It meant uncle
Sid's shoe store.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the "corporate ladder" was
still very much alive.</span> <span class="s s11">The standard plan was to try to get into a
good college, from which one would be drafted into some organization
and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility.</span>
<span class="s s12">The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster.</span>
<span class="s s13">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">But in the late twentieth century something changed.</span> <span class="s s15">It turned out
that economies of scale were not the only force at work.</span> <span class="s s16">Particularly
in technology, the increase in speed one could get from smaller
groups started to trump the advantages of size.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting
in 1970.</span> <span class="s s18">The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed
to materialize.</span> <span class="s s19">But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges
indicating our specialty and rank.</span> <span class="s s20">Instead of being dominated by
a few, giant tree-structured organizations, it's now looking like
the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,
independent units.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">It's not so much that large organizations stopped working.</span> <span class="s s22">There's
no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman
army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by
protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today.</span>
<span class="s s23">But they were competing against opponents who couldn't change the
rules on the fly by discovering new technology.</span> <span class="s s24">Now it turns out
the rule "large and disciplined organizations win" needs to have a
qualification appended: "at games that change slowly.</span><span class="s s25">"</span> <span class="s s26">No one knew
till change reached a sufficient speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">Large organizations will start to do worse now, though,
because for the first time in history they're no longer getting the
best people.</span> <span class="s s28">An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn't
want to work for a big company.</span> <span class="s s29">They want to work for the hot
startup that's rapidly growing into one.</span> <span class="s s30">If they're really ambitious,
they want to start it.</span> 
<span class="s s31">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s32">This doesn't mean big companies will disappear.</span> <span class="s s33">To say that
startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, because
startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired
by them.</span> 
<span class="s s34">[3]
But large organizations will probably never again
play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the
twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">It's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever
run out.</span> <span class="s s36">How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands
of years, then switches polarity?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of
traditions that are now obsolete, 
but extremely deeply rooted.</span>
<span class="s s38">Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them.</span> <span class="s s39">It will
be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and
which can now be discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s40">The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the
world of startups.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US,
of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of
climbing it.</span> <span class="s s42">But till recently this was an anomalous route that
tended to be followed only by outsiders.</span> <span class="s s43">It was no coincidence
that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so
little formal education.</span> <span class="s s44">As huge as their companies eventually
became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at
first.</span> <span class="s s45">That was a social step no one with a college education would
take if they could avoid it.</span> <span class="s s46">Till the rise of technology startups,
and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for
educated people to start their own businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s47">The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild
Semiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren't even
trying to start a company at first.</span> <span class="s s48">They were just looking for a
company willing to hire them as a group.</span> <span class="s s49">Then one of their parents
introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find
funding for them to start their own, so they did.</span> <span class="s s50">But starting a
company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed
into.</span>
<span class="s s51">[4]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley
undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea
of starting a startup.</span> <span class="s s53">East Coast universities are not far behind,
and British universities only a little behind them.</span> <span class="s s54">This pattern
suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly,
but a leading indicator.</span> <span class="s s55">This is the way the world is going.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world's
economy. Could a trend based on them be that powerful?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">I think so.</span> <span class="s s58">There's no reason to suppose there's any limit to the
amount of work that could be done in this area.</span> <span class="s s59">Like science,
wealth seems to expand fractally.</span> <span class="s s60">Steam power was a sliver of the
British economy when Watt started working on it.</span> <span class="s s61">But his work led
to more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger
than the whole economy of which it had initially been a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">The same thing could happen with the Internet.</span> <span class="s s63">If Internet startups
offer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of
ambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will
balloon in the usual fractal way.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the
world's economy, this component will set the tone for the rest.</span>
<span class="s s65">The most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everything
from salaries to standards of dress.</span> <span class="s s66">Not just because of its
prestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamic
part of the economy tend to be ones that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small,
autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.</span> <span class="s s68">And
the societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">As with the original industrial revolution, some societies are going
to be better at this than others.</span> <span class="s s70">Within a generation of its birth
in England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental
Europe and North America.</span> <span class="s s71">But it didn't spread everywhere.</span> <span class="s s72">This
new way of doing things could only take root in places that were
prepared for it.</span> <span class="s s73">It could only spread to places that already had
a vigorous middle class.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s74">There is a similar social component to the transformation that began
in Silicon Valley in the 1960s.</span> <span class="s s75">Two new kinds of techniques were
developed there: techniques for building integrated circuits, and
techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast
by creating new technology.</span> <span class="s s76">The techniques for building integrated
circuits spread rapidly to other countries.</span> <span class="s s77">But the techniques for
building startups didn't.</span> <span class="s s78">Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous
in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but
they're still an anomaly in most of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s79">Part of the reason&mdash;possibly the main reason&mdash;that startups
have not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their
social disruptiveness.</span> <span class="s s80">Though it brought many social changes, the
Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger
is better.</span> <span class="s s81">Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully.</span>
<span class="s s82">The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large
organizations like the military and the civil service, and the
resulting hybrid worked well.</span> <span class="s s83">"Captains of industry" issued orders
to "armies of workers," and everyone knew what they were supposed
to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s84">Startups seem to go more against the grain, socially.</span> <span class="s s85">It's hard
for them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability,
just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies
ruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class.</span> <span class="s s86">But
there were already a handful of countries past that stage when the
Industrial Revolution happened.</span> <span class="s s87">There do not seem to be that many
ready this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s88">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s89">[1]
One of the bizarre consequences of this model was that the usual
way to make more money was to become a manager.</span> <span class="s s90">This is one of the
things startups fix.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">[2]
There are a lot of reasons American car companies have been
doing so much worse than Japanese car companies, but at least one
of them is a cause for optimism: American graduates have more
options.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s92">[3]
It's possible that companies will one day be able to grow big
in revenues without growing big in people, but we are not very far
along that trend yet.</span></p>
