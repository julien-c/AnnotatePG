  <h2><span class="s s1">Organic Startup Ideas</span></h2>

April 2010</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the
question: what do you wish someone would make for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically
out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you.</span> <span class="s s5">Apple
was the first type.</span> <span class="s s6">Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer.</span> <span class="s s7">Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design
one, so he did.</span> <span class="s s8">And since lots of other people wanted the same
thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company
rolling.</span> <span class="s s9">They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.</span>
<span class="s s10">The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants.</span>
<span class="s s11">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s12">Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type.</span> <span class="s s13">We made software
for building online stores.</span> <span class="s s14">We didn't need this software ourselves.</span>
<span class="s s15">We weren't direct marketers.</span> <span class="s s16">We didn't even know when we started
that our users were called "direct marketers.</span><span class="s s17">"</span> <span class="s s18">But we were
comparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and Robert
Morris was 29), so we'd seen enough to know users would need this
type of software.</span>
<span class="s s19">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but
the most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type
than the Viaweb type.</span> <span class="s s21">When he was writing that first Basic interpreter
for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as
were Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but
particularly so when the founders are young.</span> <span class="s s23">It takes experience
to predict what other people will want.</span> <span class="s s24">The worst ideas we see at
Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other
people will want.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">So if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're
going to do, I'd encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas.</span>
<span class="s s26">What's missing or broken in your daily life?</span> <span class="s s27">Sometimes if you just
ask that question you'll get immediate answers.</span> <span class="s s28">It must have seemed
obviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the
Altair in machine language.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,
because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted.</span> <span class="s s30">You
can be sure it's there, though.</span> <span class="s s31">There are always great ideas sitting
right under our noses.</span> <span class="s s32">In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard
undergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper.</span> <span class="s s33">Surely
that sort of thing should have been online.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s34">There are ideas that obvious lying around now.</span> <span class="s s35">The reason you're
overlooking them is the same reason you'd have overlooked the idea
of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don't
seem like startup ideas at first.</span> <span class="s s36">We know now that Facebook was
very successful, but put yourself back in 2004.</span> <span class="s s37">Putting undergraduates'
profiles online wouldn't have seemed like much of a startup idea.</span>
<span class="s s38">And in fact, it wasn't initially a startup idea.</span> <span class="s s39">When Mark spoke
at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a
company when he wrote the first version of Facebook.</span> <span class="s s40">It was just
a project.</span> <span class="s s41">So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on
it.</span> <span class="s s42">He didn't think he was starting a company.</span> <span class="s s43">If these guys had
thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted
to do something more "serious," and that would have been a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage
you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.</span>
<span class="s s45">Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems
like the problem is important enough to build a company on.</span> <span class="s s46">If you
keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making
something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,
you've got a company.</span>
<span class="s s47">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s48">Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something
other people dismiss as a toy.</span> <span class="s s49">In fact, that's a good sign.</span>
<span class="s s50">That's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.</span> <span class="s s51">The first
microcomputers were dismissed as toys.</span> <span class="s s52">And the first planes, and
the first cars.</span> <span class="s s53">At this point, when someone comes to us with
something that users like but that we could envision forum trolls
dismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s54">While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with
made-up ideas, they're the best source of organic ones, because
they're at the forefront of technology.</span> <span class="s s55">They use the latest stuff.</span>
<span class="s s56">They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn't they?</span> <span class="s s57">And
because they use the latest stuff, they're in a position to discover
valuable types of fixable brokenness first.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s58">There's nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just
becoming fixable.</span> <span class="s s59">If you find something broken that you can fix
for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine.</span> <span class="s s60">As with an actual
gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it.</span>
<span class="s s61">But at least you know where the seam is, and that's the hard part.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s62">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s63">[1]
This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak:
things Steve Jobs doesn't use. E.g. I doubt he is much into gaming.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">[2]
In retrospect, we should have become direct marketers.</span> <span class="s s65">If
I were doing Viaweb again, I'd open our own online store.</span> <span class="s s66">If we
had, we'd have understood users a lot better.</span> <span class="s s67">I'd encourage anyone
starting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it
seems.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s68">[3]
Possible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software.</span>
<span class="s s69">You can build things for programmers, but there has to be some part
you can charge for.</span></p>
