  <h2><span class="s s1">Some Heroes</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">April 2008</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">There are some topics I save up because they'll be so much fun to
write about. This is one of them: a list of my heroes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s4">I'm not claiming this is a list of the n most admirable people.
Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s5">Einstein isn't on the list, for example, even though he probably
deserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.</span> <span class="s s6">I once asked
a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame
implies, and she said that yes, he was.</span> <span class="s s7">So why isn't he on the
list?</span> <span class="s s8">Because I had to ask.</span> <span class="s s9">This is a list of people who've
influenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">My test was to think of someone and ask "is this person my
hero?</span><span class="s s11">"</span> <span class="s s12">It often returned surprising answers.</span> <span class="s s13">For example,
it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of
the essay.</span> <span class="s s14">Why?</span> <span class="s s15">When I thought
about what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I'd decide what
to do by asking what they'd do in the same situation.</span> <span class="s s16">That's a 
stricter standard than admiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, and
there was, a very clear one.</span> <span class="s s18">Everyone on the list had two qualities:
they cared almost excessively about their work, and they were
absolutely honest.</span> <span class="s s19">By honest I don't mean trustworthy so much as
that they never pander: they never say or do something because
that's what the audience wants.</span> <span class="s s20">They are all fundamentally subversive
for this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s21">Jack Lambert</span></p>
<p><span class="s s22">I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s.</span> <span class="s s23">Unless you were there it's
hard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers.</span> <span class="s s24">Locally,
all the news was bad.</span> <span class="s s25">The steel industry was dying.</span> <span class="s s26">But the
Steelers were the best team in football&mdash;and moreover, in a
way that seemed to reflect the personality of the city.</span> <span class="s s27">They didn't
do anything fancy.</span> <span class="s s28">They just got the job done.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn
Swann.</span> <span class="s s30">But they played offense, and you always get more attention
for that.</span> <span class="s s31">It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expert
that the best of them all was 
Jack Lambert.</span> <span class="s s32">And what made him so
good was that he was utterly relentless.</span> <span class="s s33">He didn't just care about
playing well; he cared almost too much.</span> <span class="s s34">He seemed to regard it as
a personal insult when someone from the other team had possession
of the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s35">The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place.</span>
<span class="s s36">School was boring.</span> <span class="s s37">All the adults around were bored with their
jobs working for big companies.</span> <span class="s s38">Everything that came to us through
the mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere.</span>
<span class="s s39">Jack Lambert was the exception.</span> <span class="s s40">He was like nothing else I'd seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">Kenneth Clark</span></p>
<p><span class="s s42">Kenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on any
subject.</span> <span class="s s43">Most people who write about art history don't really like
art; you can tell from a thousand little signs.</span> <span class="s s44">But Clark did, and
not just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a delicious
dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s45">What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of his
ideas.</span> <span class="s s46">His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in 
his books than in a library
of art monographs.</span> <span class="s s47">Reading 
The Nude is like a ride in a
Ferrari.</span> <span class="s s48">Just as you're getting settled, you're slammed back in
your seat by the acceleration.</span> <span class="s s49">Before you can adjust, you're thrown
sideways as the car screeches into the first turn.</span> <span class="s s50">His brain throws
off ideas almost too fast to grasp them.</span> <span class="s s51">Finally at the end of the
chapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile on
your face.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s52">Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentary
series 
Civilisation.</span> <span class="s s53">And if you read only one book about
art history, 
Civilisation is the one I'd recommend.</span> <span class="s s54">It's
much better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduates
are forced to buy for Art History 101.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">Larry Mihalko</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">A lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood.</span>
<span class="s s57">Larry Mihalko was mine.</span> <span class="s s58">When I look back it's like there's a line
drawn between third and fourth grade.</span> <span class="s s59">After Mr. Mihalko, everything
was different.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s60">Why?</span> <span class="s s61">First of all, he was intellectually curious.</span> <span class="s s62">I had a few
other teachers who were smart, but I wouldn't describe them as
intellectually curious.</span> <span class="s s63">In retrospect, he was out of place as an
elementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.</span> <span class="s s64">That must have
been hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students.</span> <span class="s s65">His
class was a constant adventure.</span> <span class="s s66">I used to like going to school
every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s67">The other thing that made him different was that he liked us.</span> <span class="s s68">Kids
are good at telling that.</span> <span class="s s69">The other teachers were at best benevolently
indifferent.</span> <span class="s s70">But Mr. Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to
be our friend.</span> <span class="s s71">On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of
the heavy school record players and played James Taylor's "You've
Got a Friend" to us.</span> <span class="s s72">Just call out my name, and you know wherever
I am, I'll come running.</span> <span class="s s73">He died at 59 of lung cancer.</span> <span class="s s74">I've never
cried like I cried at his funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s75">Leonardo</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">One of the things I've learned about making things that I didn't
realize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn't made
for audiences, but for oneself.</span> <span class="s s77">You see paintings and drawings in
museums and imagine they were made for you to look at.</span> <span class="s s78">Actually a
lot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not
as a way to please other people.</span> <span class="s s79">The best of these explorations
are sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s80">Leonardo did a lot of things.</span> <span class="s s81">One of his most admirable qualities
was that he did so many different things that were admirable.</span> <span class="s s82">What
people know of him now is his paintings and his more flamboyant
inventions, like flying machines.</span> <span class="s s83">That makes him seem like some
kind of dreamer who sketched artists' conceptions of rocket ships
on the side.</span> <span class="s s84">In fact he made a large number of far more practical
technical discoveries.</span> <span class="s s85">He was as good an engineer as a painter.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s86">His most impressive work, to me, is his 
drawings.</span> <span class="s s87">They're clearly
made more as a way of studying the world than producing something
beautiful.</span> <span class="s s88">And yet they can hold their own with any work of art
ever made.</span> <span class="s s89">No one else, before or since, was that good when no one
was looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">Robert Morris</span></p>
<p><span class="s s91">Robert Morris has a very unusual quality: he's never wrong.</span> <span class="s s92">It
might seem this would require you to be omniscient, but actually
it's surprisingly easy.</span> <span class="s s93">Don't say anything unless you're fairly
sure of it.</span> <span class="s s94">If you're not omniscient, you just don't end up saying
much.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s95">More precisely, the trick is to pay careful attention to how you
qualify what you say.</span> <span class="s s96">By using this trick, Robert has, as far as
I know, managed to be mistaken only once, and that was when he was
an undergrad.</span> <span class="s s97">When the Mac came out, he said that little desktop
computers would never be suitable for real hacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s98">It's wrong to call it a trick in his case, though.</span> <span class="s s99">If it were a
conscious trick, he would have slipped in a moment of excitement.</span>
<span class="s s100">With Robert this quality is wired-in.</span> <span class="s s101">He has an almost superhuman
integrity.</span> <span class="s s102">He's not just generally correct, but also correct about
how correct he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s103">You'd think it would be such a great thing never to be wrong that
everyone would do this.</span> <span class="s s104">It doesn't seem like that much extra work
to pay as much attention to the error on an idea as to the idea
itself.</span> <span class="s s105">And yet practically no one does.</span> <span class="s s106">I know how hard it is,
because since meeting Robert I've tried to do in software what he
seems to do in hardware.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s107">P. G. Wodehouse</span></p>
<p><span class="s s108">People are finally starting to admit that Wodehouse was a great
writer.</span> <span class="s s109">If you want to be thought a great novelist in your own
time, you have to sound intellectual.</span> <span class="s s110">If what you write is popular,
or entertaining, or funny, you're ipso facto suspect.</span> <span class="s s111">That makes
Wodehouse doubly impressive, because it meant that to write as he
wanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s112">Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at the
time that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perverse
gesture.</span> <span class="s s113">At the time any random autobiographical novel by a recent
college grad could count on more respectful treatment from the
literary establishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s114">Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composed
them into molecules was near faultless.</span> <span class="s s115">His rhythm in particular.</span>
<span class="s s116">It makes me self-conscious to write about it.</span> <span class="s s117">I can think of only
two other writers who came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh and
Nancy Mitford.</span> <span class="s s118">Those three used the English language like they
owned it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s119">But Wodehouse has something neither of them did.</span> <span class="s s120">He's at ease.</span>
<span class="s s121">Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford cared what other people thought of
them: he wanted to seem aristocratic; she was afraid she wasn't
smart enough.</span> <span class="s s122">But Wodehouse didn't give a damn what anyone thought
of him.</span> <span class="s s123">He wrote exactly what he wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s124">Alexander Calder</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">Calder's on this list because he makes me happy.</span> <span class="s s126">Can his work stand
up to Leonardo's?</span> <span class="s s127">Probably not.</span> <span class="s s128">There might not be anything from
the 20th Century that can.</span> <span class="s s129">But what was good about Modernism,
Calder had, and had in a way that he made seem effortless.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s130">What was good about Modernism was its freshness.</span> <span class="s s131">Art became stuffy
in the nineteenth century.</span> <span class="s s132">The paintings that were popular at the
time were mostly the art equivalent of McMansions&mdash;big,
pretentious, and fake.</span> <span class="s s133">Modernism meant starting over, making things
with the same earnest motives that children might.</span> <span class="s s134">The artists who
benefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child's
confidence, like Klee and Calder.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s135">Klee was impressive because he could work in so many different
styles.</span> <span class="s s136">But between the two I like Calder better, because his work
seemed happier.</span> <span class="s s137">Ultimately the point of art is to engage the viewer.</span>
<span class="s s138">It's hard to predict what will; often something that seems interesting
at first will bore you after a month.</span> <span class="s s139">Calder's 
sculptures never
get boring.</span> <span class="s s140">They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, like
a battery that never runs out.</span> <span class="s s141">As far as I can tell from books and
photographs, the happiness of Calder's work is his own happiness
showing through.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s142">Jane Austen</span></p>
<p><span class="s s143">Everyone admires Jane Austen. Add my name to the list. To me she
seems the best novelist of all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s144">I'm interested in how things work.</span> <span class="s s145">When I read most novels, I pay
as much attention to the author's choices as to the story.</span> <span class="s s146">But in
her novels I can't see the gears at work.</span> <span class="s s147">Though I'd really like
to know how she does what she does, I can't figure it out, because
she's so good that her stories don't seem made up.</span> <span class="s s148">I feel like I'm
reading a description of something that actually happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s149">I used to read a lot of novels when I was younger.</span> <span class="s s150">I can't read
most anymore, because they don't have enough information in them.</span>
<span class="s s151">Novels seem so impoverished compared to history and biography.</span> <span class="s s152">But 
reading Austen is like reading
nonfiction.</span> <span class="s s153">She writes so well you don't even notice her.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s154">John McCarthy</span></p>
<p><span class="s s155">John McCarthy invented Lisp, the field of (or at least the term)
artificial intelligence, and was an early member of both of the top
two computer science departments, MIT and Stanford.</span> <span class="s s156">No one would
dispute that he's one of the greats, but he's an especial hero to
me because of 
Lisp.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s157">It's hard for us now to understand what a conceptual leap that was
at the time.</span> <span class="s s158">Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement is
hard to appreciate is that it was so successful.</span> <span class="s s159">Practically every
programming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideas
from Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s160">In 1958 these ideas were anything but obvious.</span> <span class="s s161">In 1958 there seem
to have been two ways of thinking about programming.</span> <span class="s s162">Some people
thought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines.</span>
<span class="s s163">Others thought of it as a way to get things done, and designed
languages all too influenced by the technology of the day.</span> <span class="s s164">McCarthy
alone bridged the gap.</span> <span class="s s165">He designed a language that was math.</span> <span class="s s166">But
designed is not really the word; discovered is more like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s167">The Spitfire</span></p>
<p><span class="s s168">As I was making this list I found myself thinking of people like
Douglas Bader 
and 
R.</span><span class="s s169">J.</span> <span class="s s170">Mitchell
 and 
Jeffrey Quill and I realized
that though all of them had done many things in their lives, there
was one factor above all that connected them: the Spitfire.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s171">This is supposed to be a list of heroes.</span> <span class="s s172">How can a machine be on
it?</span> <span class="s s173">Because that machine was not just a machine.</span> <span class="s s174">It was a lens
of heroes.</span> <span class="s s175">Extraordinary devotion went into it, and extraordinary
courage came out.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s176">It's a cliche to call World War II a contest between good and evil,
but between fighter designs, it really was.</span> <span class="s s177">The Spitfire's original
nemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane.</span> <span class="s s178">It was a
killing machine.</span> <span class="s s179">The Spitfire was optimism embodied.</span> <span class="s s180">And not just
in its beautiful lines: it was at the edge of what could be
manufactured.</span> <span class="s s181">But taking the high road worked.</span> <span class="s s182">In the air, beauty
had the edge, just.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s183">Steve Jobs</span></p>
<p><span class="s s184">People alive when Kennedy was killed usually remember exactly where
they were when they heard about it.</span> <span class="s s185">I remember exactly where I was
when a friend asked if I'd heard Steve Jobs had cancer.</span> <span class="s s186">It was
like the floor dropped out.</span> <span class="s s187">A few seconds later she told me that
it was a rare operable type, and that he'd be ok.</span> <span class="s s188">But those seconds
seemed long.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">I wasn't sure whether to include Jobs on this list.</span> <span class="s s190">A lot of people
at Apple seem to be afraid of him, which is a bad sign.</span> <span class="s s191">But he
compels admiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s192">There's no name for what Steve Jobs is, because there hasn't been
anyone quite like him before.</span> <span class="s s193">He doesn't design Apple's products
himself.</span> <span class="s s194">Historically the closest analogy to what he does are the
great Renaissance patrons of the arts.</span> <span class="s s195">As the CEO of a company,
that makes him unique.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s196">Most CEOs delegate 
taste to a subordinate.</span>
<span class="s s197">The 
design paradox
 means they're choosing more or less at random.</span> <span class="s s198">But Steve
Jobs actually has taste himself&mdash;such good taste that he's shown
the world how much more important taste is than they realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s199">Isaac Newton</span></p>
<p><span class="s s200">Newton has a strange role in my pantheon of heroes: he's the one I
reproach myself with.</span> <span class="s s201">He worked on big things, at least for part
of his life.</span> <span class="s s202">It's so easy to get distracted working on small stuff.</span>
<span class="s s203">The questions you're answering are pleasantly familiar.</span> <span class="s s204">You get
immediate rewards&mdash;in fact, you get bigger rewards in your
time if you work on matters of passing importance.</span> <span class="s s205">But I'm
uncomfortably aware that this is the route to well-deserved obscurity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s206">To do really great things, you have to seek out questions people
didn't even realize were questions.</span> <span class="s s207">There have probably been other
people who did this as well as Newton, for their time, but Newton
is my model of this kind of thought.</span> <span class="s s208">I can just begin to understand
what it must have felt like for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s209">You only get one life.</span> <span class="s s210">Why not do something huge?</span> <span class="s s211">The phrase "paradigm
shift" is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something.</span> <span class="s s212">And you know
more are out there, separated from us by what will later seem a
surprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.</span> <span class="s s213">If we work like
Newton.</span></p>
