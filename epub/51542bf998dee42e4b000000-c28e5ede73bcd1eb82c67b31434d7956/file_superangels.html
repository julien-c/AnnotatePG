  <h2><span class="s s1">The New Funding Landscape</span></h2>
<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
October 2010</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding
business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called
turmoil.</span> <span class="s s4">At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding
environment for startups.</span> <span class="s s5">Fortunately one of them is much higher
valuations.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s6">The trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific.</span> <span class="s s7">I wish
I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we
see trends first&mdash;partly because the startups we fund are very
plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything
new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data
points to see patterns clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s8">What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in
the next couple years.</span> <span class="s s9">So I'm going to explain what we're seeing,
and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s10">Super-Angels</span></p>
<p><span class="s s11">Let me start by describing what the world of startup funding used
to look like.</span> <span class="s s12">There used to be two sharply differentiated types
of investors: angels and venture capitalists.</span> <span class="s s13">Angels are individual
rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs
are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now
a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called
super-angels.</span> 
<span class="s s15">[1]
 And VCs have been provoked by their arrival
into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.</span> <span class="s s16">So the
previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly
blurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s17">There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs.</span> <span class="s s18">Angels
would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.</span>
<span class="s s19">So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that
combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in
which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient
one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted
to raise.</span> <span class="s s21">Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise
around $400k.</span> <span class="s s22">But it was a pain to stitch together that much out
of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments
so small.</span> <span class="s s23">That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have
appeared.</span> <span class="s s24">They're responding to the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s25">The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,
because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one
another.</span> <span class="s s26">Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.</span> <span class="s s27">That's
going to change the rules about how to raise money.</span> <span class="s s28">I don't know
yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes
will be for the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s29">A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of
the qualities of a VC.</span> <span class="s s30">They're usually individuals, like angels.</span>
<span class="s s31">In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of
the classic type.</span> <span class="s s32">But like VCs, they invest other people's money.</span>
<span class="s s33">This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels: a typical
super-angel investment is currently about $100k.</span> <span class="s s34">They make investment
decisions quickly, like angels.</span> <span class="s s35">And they make a lot more investments
per partner than VCs&mdash;up to 10 times as many.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s36">The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them
doubly alarming to VCs.</span> <span class="s s37">They don't just compete for startups; they
also compete for investors.</span> <span class="s s38">What super-angels really are is a new
form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.</span> <span class="s s39">And those of us in the
technology world know what usually happens when something comes
along that can be described in terms like that.</span> <span class="s s40">Usually it's the
replacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s41">Will it be?</span> <span class="s s42">As of now, few of the startups that take money from
super-angels are ruling out taking VC money.</span> <span class="s s43">They're just postponing
it.</span> <span class="s s44">But that's still a problem for VCs.</span> <span class="s s45">Some of the startups that
postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they
raise that they never bother to raise more.</span> <span class="s s46">And those who do raise
VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.</span> <span class="s s47">If
the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series
A rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold.</span>
<span class="s s48">[2]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s49">So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.</span>
<span class="s s50">But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven
distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are
concentrated in a few big successes.</span> <span class="s s51">The expected value of a startup
is the percentage chance it's Google.</span> <span class="s s52">So to the extent that winning
is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically
all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if
they merely failed to get those few big winners.</span> <span class="s s53">And there's a
chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better
brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.</span> 
<span class="s s54">[3]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s55">Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have
less partner per investment.</span> <span class="s s56">They can't pay as much attention to
you as a VC on your board could.</span> <span class="s s57">How much is that extra attention
worth?</span> <span class="s s58">It will vary enormously from one partner to another.</span> <span class="s s59">There's
no consensus yet in the general case.</span> <span class="s s60">So for now this is something
startups are deciding individually.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s61">Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of
like the government's.</span> <span class="s s62">Maybe they made you feel better, but you
had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only
VCs could supply.</span> <span class="s s63">Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to
put a market price on the help they offer.</span> <span class="s s64">The interesting thing
is, no one knows yet what it will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s65">Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and
connections only the top VCs can supply?</span> <span class="s s66">Or would super-angel money
do just as well?</span> <span class="s s67">The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels
will say you don't.</span> <span class="s s68">But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even
the VCs and super-angels themselves.</span> <span class="s s69">All the super-angels know
is that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,
and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry
about.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s70">Rounds</span></p>
<p><span class="s s71">Whatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is
good news for founders.</span> <span class="s s72">And not just for the obvious reason that
more competition for deals means better terms. The whole shape of
deals is changing.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s73">One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount
of your company they want.</span> <span class="s s74">VCs want a lot.</span> <span class="s s75">In a series A round
they want a third of your company, if they can get it.</span> <span class="s s76">They don't
care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the
number of series A investments they can do is so small.</span> <span class="s s77">In a
traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC
fund takes a seat on your board.</span> 
<span class="s s78">[4]
 Since board seats last about
5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once,
that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner
per year.</span> <span class="s s79">And that means they need to get as much of the company
as they can in each one.</span> <span class="s s80">You'd have to be a very promising startup
indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a
few percent of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s81">Since angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this
constraint.</span> <span class="s s82">They're happy to buy only a few percent of you.</span> <span class="s s83">And
although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've
retained this critical property of angels.</span> <span class="s s84">They don't take board
seats, so they don't need a big percentage of your company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s85">Though that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from
them, it's good news in other respects.</span> <span class="s s86">Founders never really liked
giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.</span> <span class="s s87">It was a lot of the company
to give up in one shot.</span> <span class="s s88">Most founders doing series A deals would
prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then
see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock
after using the first half of the money to increase its value.</span> <span class="s s89">But
VCs never offered that option.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">Now startups have another alternative.</span> <span class="s s91">Now it's easy to raise angel
rounds about half the size of series A rounds.</span> <span class="s s92">Many of the startups
we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of
startups in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s93">A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with
a valuation cap of $4 million premoney.</span> <span class="s s94">Meaning that when the note
converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the
investors in that round will get .</span><span class="s s95">6 / 4.</span><span class="s s96">6, or 13% of the company.</span>
<span class="s s97">That's a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually
give up in a series A round if you do it so early.</span> 
<span class="s s98">[5]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that
they cause less dilution.</span> <span class="s s100">You also lose less control.</span> <span class="s s101">After an
angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the
company, whereas after a series A round they often don't.</span> <span class="s s102">The
traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders,
two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.</span> <span class="s s103">Plus series A
terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of
important decisions, including selling the company.</span> <span class="s s104">Founders usually
have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things
are going well.</span> <span class="s s105">But that's not the same as just being able to do
what you want, like you could before.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s106">A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that
they're less stressful to raise.</span> <span class="s s107">Raising a traditional series A
round has in the past taken weeks, if not months.</span> <span class="s s108">When a VC firm
can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about
which they do.</span> <span class="s s109">To get a traditional series A round you have to go
through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting
where the firm as a whole says yes or no.</span> <span class="s s110">That's the really scary
part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but
at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.</span> <span class="s s111">The
chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages
about 25%.</span> <span class="s s112">At some firms it's over 50%.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s113">Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.</span>
<span class="s s114">Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.</span>
<span class="s s115">But they're still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most
decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s116">Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback
as it progresses.</span> <span class="s s117">An angel round is not an all or nothing thing
like a series A.</span> <span class="s s118">It's composed of multiple investors with varying
degrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit
unequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like "come back to
me to fill out the round.</span><span class="s s119">"</span> <span class="s s120">You usually start collecting money from
the most committed investors and work your way out toward the
ambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s121">But at each point you know how you're doing.</span> <span class="s s122">If investors turn
cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel
round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead
of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens
if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.</span>
<span class="s s123">Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round
faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm,
actually raise the price to reflect demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s124">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="s s125">However, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels,
and they have started to use it.</span> <span class="s s126">VCs have started making angel-sized
investments too.</span> <span class="s s127">The term "angel round" doesn't mean that all the
investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the
round.</span> <span class="s s128">Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments
of a hundred thousand or two.</span> <span class="s s129">And when VCs invest in angel rounds
they can do things that super-angels don't like.</span> <span class="s s130">VCs are quite
valuation-insensitive in angel rounds&mdash;partly because they are
in general, and partly because they don't care that much about the
returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to
recruit startups for series A rounds later.</span> <span class="s s131">So VCs who invest in
angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels
who invest in them.</span> 
<span class="s s132">[6]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s133">Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.</span> <span class="s s134">Several turned
down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations
were too high.</span> <span class="s s135">This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.</span>
<span class="s s136">But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble
about valuations.</span> <span class="s s137">Did they not understand that the big returns
come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far
more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s138">After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other
signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be
smarter than they seem.</span> <span class="s s139">It would make sense for super-angels to
want low valuations if they're hoping to invest in startups that
get bought early.</span> <span class="s s140">If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you
shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million.</span> <span class="s s141">But if you're looking
for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.</span>
<span class="s s142">If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only
get 1.</span><span class="s s143">5x.</span> <span class="s s144">You might as well buy Apple.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s145">So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could
get acquired quickly, that would explain why they'd care about
valuations.</span> <span class="s s146">But why would they be looking for those?</span> <span class="s s147">Because
depending on the meaning of "quickly," it could actually be very
profitable.</span> <span class="s s148">A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure
to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover,
a quick 10x return.</span> <span class="s s149">Rate of return is what matters in
investing&mdash;not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year.</span>
<span class="s s150">If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of
return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6
years to go public.</span> <span class="s s151">To get the same rate of return, the VC would
have to get a multiple of 10^6&mdash;one million x.</span> <span class="s s152">Even Google
didn't come close to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s153">So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies
that will get bought.</span> <span class="s s154">That's the only rational explanation for
focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right
companies.</span> <span class="s s155">And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs.</span>
<span class="s s156">They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accomodating if you want
to sell early.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s157">Prognosis</span></p>
<p><span class="s s158">Who will win, the super-angels or the VCs?</span> <span class="s s159">I think the answer to
that is, some of each.</span> <span class="s s160">They'll each become more like one another.</span>
<span class="s s161">The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCs
will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments
faster.</span> <span class="s s162">A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart,
and there will probably be survivors from each group.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s163">What does that mean for founders?</span> <span class="s s164">One thing it means is that the
high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever.</span>
<span class="s s165">To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive
VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and
start to become more miserly about valuations.</span> <span class="s s166">Fortunately if this
does happen it will take years.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s167">The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which
is good news for you.</span> <span class="s s168">The super-angels will try to undermine the
VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the
super-angels by driving up valuations.</span> <span class="s s169">Which for founders will
result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast,
with high valuations.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s170">But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have
to appeal to both super-angels and VCs.</span> <span class="s s171">If you don't seem like you
have the potential to go public, you won't be able to use VCs to
drive up the valuation of an angel round.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s172">There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called
signalling risk.</span> <span class="s s173">If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing
more later, what happens if they don't?</span> <span class="s s174">That's a signal to everyone
else that they think you're lame.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s175">How much should you worry about that?</span> <span class="s s176">The seriousness of signalling
risk depends on how far along you are.</span> <span class="s s177">If by the next time you
need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or
traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals
your existing investors are sending.</span> <span class="s s178">Your results will speak for
themselves.</span> 
<span class="s s179">[7]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s180">Whereas if the next time you need to raise money you won't yet have
concrete results, you may need to think more about the message your
investors might send if they don't invest more.</span> <span class="s s181">I'm not sure yet
how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs
doing angel investments is so new.</span> <span class="s s182">But my instincts tell me you
don't have to worry much.</span> <span class="s s183">Signalling risk smells like one of those
things founders worry about that's not a real problem.</span> <span class="s s184">As a rule,
the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself.</span>
<span class="s s185">Startups hurt themselves way more often than competitors hurt them,
for example.</span> <span class="s s186">I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s187">One thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the risk
of taking money from VCs in angel rounds is not to take too much
from any one VC.</span> <span class="s s188">Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of
turning down money.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s189">Fortunately, more and more startups will.</span> <span class="s s190">After decades of competition
that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding
business is finally getting some real competition.</span> <span class="s s191">That should
last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer.</span> <span class="s s192">Unless there's
some huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be a
good time for startups to raise money.</span> <span class="s s193">And that's exciting because
it means lots more startups will happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s194">Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="s s195">[1]
I've also heard them called "Mini-VCs" and "Micro-VCs." I
don't know which name will stick.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s196">There were a couple predecessors.</span> <span class="s s197">Ron Conway had angel funds
starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a
super-angel than a VC fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">[2]
It wouldn't cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing
later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments
that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage
of startups as they do now.</span> <span class="s s199">So it's hard to predict precisely what
would happen to their returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s200">[3]
The brand of an investor derives mostly from the success of
their portfolio companies.</span> <span class="s s201">The top VCs thus have a big brand
advantage over the super-angels.</span> <span class="s s202">They could make it self-perpetuating
if they used it to get all the best new startups.</span> <span class="s s203">But I don't think
they'll be able to.</span> <span class="s s204">To get all the best startups, you have to do
more than make them want you.</span> <span class="s s205">You also have to want them; you have
to recognize them when you see them, and that's much harder.</span>
<span class="s s206">Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss.</span> <span class="s s207">And that will cause
the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually
to erode.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s208">[4]
Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners
on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve
board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round
board, consisting of two founders and one VC.</span> <span class="s s209">Which is also to the
founders' advantage if it means they still control the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s210">[5]
In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than
the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you
dilute yourselves to set aside an "option pool" as well.</span> <span class="s s211">I predict
this practice will gradually disappear though.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s212">[6]
The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible
note with no valuation cap at all.</span> <span class="s s213">In that case the money invested
in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the
next round, no matter how large.</span> <span class="s s214">Angels and super-angels tend not
to like uncapped notes.</span> <span class="s s215">They have no idea how much of the company
they're buying.</span> <span class="s s216">If the company does well and the valuation of the
next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it.</span> <span class="s s217">So
by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations
in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s218">[7]
Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll
never need to raise more money. But startups are often mistaken
about that.</span></p>
