  <h2><span class="s s1">6,631,372</span></h2>
<div><div><span class="s s2">March 2006, rev August 2009A couple days ago I found to my surprise that I'd been granted a
patent.</span>
<span class="s s3">It issued in 2003, but no one told me.</span> <span class="s s4">I wouldn't know about it
now except that a few months ago, while visiting Yahoo, I happened
to run into a Big Cheese I knew from working there in the late
nineties.</span> <span class="s s5">He brought up something called Revenue Loop, which Viaweb
had been working on when they bought us.</span><span class="s s6">The idea is basically that you sort search results not in order of
textual "relevance" (as search engines did then) nor in order of
how much advertisers bid (as Overture did) but in order of the bid
times the number of transactions.</span> <span class="s s7">Ordinarily you'd do this for
shopping searches, though in fact one of the features of our scheme
is that it automatically detects which searches are shopping searches.</span><span class="s s8">If you just order the results in order of bids, you can make the
search results useless, because the first results could be dominated
by lame sites that had bid the most.</span> <span class="s s9">But if you order results by
bid multiplied by transactions, far from selling out, you're getting
a better measure of relevance.</span> <span class="s s10">What could be a better sign that
someone was satisfied with a search result than going to the site
and buying something?</span><span class="s s11">And, of course, this algorithm automatically maximizes the revenue
of the search engine.</span><span class="s s12">Everyone is focused on this type of approach now, but few were in
1998.</span> <span class="s s13">In 1998 it was all about selling banner ads.</span> <span class="s s14">We didn't know
that, so we were pretty excited when we figured out what seemed to
us the optimal way of doing shopping searches.</span><span class="s s15">When Yahoo was thinking of buying us, we had a meeting with Jerry
Yang in New York.</span> <span class="s s16">For him, I now realize, this was supposed to be
one of those meetings when you check out a company you've pretty
much decided to buy, just to make sure they're ok guys.</span> <span class="s s17">We weren't
expected to do more than chat and seem smart and reasonable.</span> <span class="s s18">He
must have been dismayed when I jumped up to the whiteboard and
launched into a presentation of our exciting new technology.</span><span class="s s19">I was just as dismayed when he didn't seem to care at all about it.</span>
<span class="s s20">At the time I thought, "boy, is this guy poker-faced.</span> <span class="s s21">We present
to him what has to be the optimal way of sorting product search
results, and he's not even curious.</span><span class="s s22">"</span> <span class="s s23">I didn't realize till much later
why he didn't care.</span> <span class="s s24">In 1998, advertisers were overpaying enormously
for ads on web sites.</span> 
<span class="s s25">In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth to
them, Yahoo's revenues would have decreased.</span><span class="s s26">Things are different now, of course.</span> <span class="s s27">Now this sort of thing is all
the rage.</span> <span class="s s28">So when I ran into the Yahoo exec I knew from the old
days in the Yahoo cafeteria a few months ago, the first thing he
remembered was not (fortunately) all the fights I had with him, but
Revenue Loop.</span><span class="s s29">"</span><span class="s s30">Well," I said, "I think we actually applied for a patent on it.</span>
<span class="s s31">I'm not sure what happened to the application after I left.</span><span class="s s32">"</span><span class="s s33">"Really?</span> <span class="s s34">That would be an important patent.</span><span class="s s35">"</span><span class="s s36">So someone investigated, and sure enough, that patent application
had continued in the pipeline for several years after, and finally
issued in 2003.</span><span class="s s37">The main thing that struck me on reading it, actually, is that
lawyers at some point messed up my nice clear writing.</span> <span class="s s38">Some clever
person with a spell checker reduced one section to Zen-like incomprehensibility:
 Also, common spelling errors will tend to get fixed.</span> <span class="s s39">For example,
 if users searching for "compact disc player" end up spending
 considerable money at sites offering compact disc players, then
 those pages will have a higher relevance for that search phrase,
 even though the phrase "compact disc player" is not present on
 those pages.</span>
<span class="s s40">(That "compat disc player" wasn't a typo, guys.</span><span class="s s41">)For the fine prose of the original, see the provisional application
of February 1998, back when we were still Viaweb and couldn't afford
to pay lawyers to turn every "a lot of" into "considerable.</span><span class="s s42">"</span></div></div>
