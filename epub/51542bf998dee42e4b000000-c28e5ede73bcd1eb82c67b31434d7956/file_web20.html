<div><div>
<p><span class="s s2">
November 2005</span></p>
<p><span class="s s3">Does "Web 2.</span><span class="s s4">0" mean anything?</span> <span class="s s5">Till recently I thought it didn't,
but the truth turns out to be more complicated.</span> <span class="s s6">Originally, yes,
it was meaningless.</span> <span class="s s7">Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.</span> <span class="s s8">And
yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it
means what I think it does, we don't need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s9">I first heard the phrase "Web 2.</span><span class="s s10">0" in the name of the Web 2.</span><span class="s s11">0
conference in 2004.</span> <span class="s s12">At the time it was supposed to mean using "the
web as a platform," which I took to refer to web-based applications.</span>
<span class="s s13">[1]</span></p>
<p><span class="s s14">So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly
led a session intended to figure out a definition of "Web 2.</span><span class="s s15">0.</span><span class="s s16">"</span>
<span class="s s17">Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform?</span> <span class="s s18">And if it
didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s19">Origins</span></p>
<p><span class="s s20">Tim says the phrase "Web 2.</span><span class="s s21">0" first
arose in "a brainstorming session between
O'Reilly and Medialive International.</span><span class="s s22">"</span> <span class="s s23">What is Medialive International?</span>
<span class="s s24">"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences," according to
their site.</span> <span class="s s25">So presumably that's what this brainstorming session
was about.</span> <span class="s s26">O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,
and they were wondering what to call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s27">I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a
new version of the web.</span> <span class="s s28">They just wanted to make the point
that the web mattered again.</span> <span class="s s29">It was a kind of semantic deficit
spending: they knew new things were coming, and the "2.</span><span class="s s30">0" referred
to whatever those might turn out to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s31">And they were right.</span> <span class="s s32">New things were coming.</span> <span class="s s33">But the new version
number led to some awkwardness in the short term.</span> <span class="s s34">In the process
of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have
decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that "2.</span><span class="s s35">0"
referred to.</span> <span class="s s36">Whatever it meant, "the web as a platform" was at
least not too constricting.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s37">The story about "Web 2.</span><span class="s s38">0" meaning the web as a platform didn't live
much past the first conference.</span> <span class="s s39">By the second conference, what
"Web 2.</span><span class="s s40">0" seemed to mean was something about democracy.</span> <span class="s s41">At least,
it did when people wrote about it online.</span> <span class="s s42">The conference itself
didn't seem very grassroots.</span> <span class="s s43">It cost $2800, so the only people who
could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s44">And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's article
about the conference in Wired News spoke of "throngs of
geeks.</span><span class="s s45">"</span> <span class="s s46">When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news
to him.</span> <span class="s s47">He said he'd originally written something like "throngs
of VCs and biz dev guys" but had later shortened it just to "throngs,"
and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into
"throngs of geeks.</span><span class="s s48">"</span> <span class="s s49">After all, a Web 2.</span><span class="s s50">0 conference would presumably
be full of geeks, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="s s51">Well, no.</span> <span class="s s52">There were about 7.</span> <span class="s s53">Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a 
suit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first.</span> <span class="s s54">I saw
him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people "that guy looks
just like Tim.</span><span class="s s55">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s56">"Oh, that's Tim. He bought a suit."
I ran after him, and sure enough, it was. He explained that he'd
just bought it in Thailand.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s57">The 2005 Web 2.</span><span class="s s58">0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows
during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot
startup.</span> <span class="s s59">There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large 
number of people determined not to miss out.</span> <span class="s s60">Miss out on what?</span>
<span class="s s61">They didn't know.</span> <span class="s s62">Whatever was going to happen&mdash;whatever Web 2.</span><span class="s s63">0
turned out to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s64">I wouldn't quite call it "Bubble 2.</span><span class="s s65">0" just because VCs are eager
to invest again.</span> <span class="s s66">The Internet is a genuinely big deal.</span> <span class="s s67">The bust
was as much an overreaction as
the boom.</span> <span class="s s68">It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of
the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there
was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s69">The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO
market is gone.</span> <span class="s s70">Venture investors
are driven by exit strategies.</span> <span class="s s71">The reason they were funding all 
those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped
to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing
all the way to the bank.</span> <span class="s s72">Now that route is closed.</span> <span class="s s73">Now the default
exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to
irrational exuberance than IPO investors.</span> <span class="s s74">The closest you'll get 
to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for 
Myspace.</span> <span class="s s75">That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s76">1. Ajax</span></p>
<p><span class="s s77">Does "Web 2.</span><span class="s s78">0" mean anything more than the name of a conference
yet?</span> <span class="s s79">I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to.</span> <span class="s s80">When people
say "Web 2.</span><span class="s s81">0" now, I have some idea what they mean.</span> <span class="s s82">And the fact
that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof
that it has started to mean something.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s83">One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still
only just bear to use without scare quotes.</span> <span class="s s84">Basically, what "Ajax"
means is "Javascript now works.</span><span class="s s85">"</span> <span class="s s86">And that in turn means that
web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop
ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s87">As you read this, a whole new generation
of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.</span> <span class="s s88">There
hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers
first appeared.</span> <span class="s s89">Even Microsoft sees it, but it's too late for them
to do anything more than leak "internal" 
documents designed to give the impression they're on top of this
new trend.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s90">In fact the new generation of software is being written way too
fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own
in house.</span> <span class="s s91">Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups
before Google does.</span> <span class="s s92">And even that's going to be hard, because
Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did
in search a few years ago.</span> <span class="s s93">After all, Google Maps, the canonical
Ajax application, was the result of a startup they bought.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s94">So ironically the original description of the Web 2.</span><span class="s s95">0 conference
turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big
component of Web 2.</span><span class="s s96">0.</span> <span class="s s97">But I'm convinced they got this right by 
accident.</span> <span class="s s98">The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google
Maps appeared and the term "Ajax" was coined.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s99">2. Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="s s100">The second big element of Web 2.</span><span class="s s101">0 is democracy.</span> <span class="s s102">We now have several
examples to prove that amateurs can 
surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to 
channel their efforts.</span> <span class="s s103">Wikipedia
may be the most famous.</span> <span class="s s104">Experts have given Wikipedia middling
reviews, but they miss the critical point: it's good enough.</span> <span class="s s105">And 
it's free, which means people actually read it.</span> <span class="s s106">On the web, articles
you have to pay for might as well not exist.</span> <span class="s s107">Even if you were 
willing to pay to read them yourself, you can't link to them.</span> 
<span class="s s108">They're not part of the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s109">Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as
news.</span> <span class="s s110">I never look at any news site now except Reddit.</span>
<span class="s s111">[2]
 I know if something major
happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it 
will show up there.</span> <span class="s s112">Why bother checking the front page of any
specific paper or magazine?</span> <span class="s s113">Reddit's like an RSS feed for the whole
web, with a filter for quality.</span> <span class="s s114">Similar sites include Digg, a technology news site that's
rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and del.</span><span class="s s115">icio.</span><span class="s s116">us, the collaborative
bookmarking network that set off the "tagging" movement.</span> <span class="s s117">And whereas
Wikipedia's main appeal is that it's good enough and free, these
sites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human
editors.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s118">The most dramatic example of Web 2.</span><span class="s s119">0 democracy is not in the selection
of ideas, but their production.</span> 
<span class="s s120">I've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's
sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers
and magazines.</span> <span class="s s121">And now I have independent evidence: the top links
on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather 
than to magazine articles or news stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s122">My experience of writing
for magazines suggests an explanation.</span> <span class="s s123">Editors.</span> <span class="s s124">They control the
topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever
you produce.</span> <span class="s s125">The result is to damp extremes.</span> <span class="s s126">Editing yields 95th
percentile writing&mdash;95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are
dragged down.</span> <span class="s s127">5% of the time you get "throngs of geeks.</span><span class="s s128">"</span></p>
<p><span class="s s129">On the web, people can publish whatever they want.</span> <span class="s s130">Nearly all of
it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.</span>
<span class="s s131">But the pool of writers is very, very large.</span> <span class="s s132">If it's large enough,
the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass 
the best in print.</span>
<span class="s s133">[3] 
And now that the web has evolved mechanisms
for selecting good stuff, the web wins net.</span> <span class="s s134">Selection beats damping,
for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s135">Even the startups are different this time around.</span> <span class="s s136">They are to the 
startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.</span> <span class="s s137">During
the Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was 
blowing through several million dollars of VC money to "get big
fast" in the most literal sense.</span> <span class="s s138">Now it means a smaller, younger, more technical group that just 
decided to make something great.</span> <span class="s s139">They'll decide later if they want 
to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on
their terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s140">3. Don't Maltreat Users</span></p>
<p><span class="s s141">I think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements
of "Web 2.</span><span class="s s142">0.</span><span class="s s143">"</span> <span class="s s144">I also see a third: not to maltreat users.</span> <span class="s s145">During
the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.</span>
<span class="s s146">And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting
them to annoying ads.</span> <span class="s s147">The very design of the average site in the 
late 90s was an abuse.</span> <span class="s s148">Many of the most popular sites were loaded
with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the
user the message: this is our site, not yours.</span> <span class="s s149">(There's a physical
analog in the Intel and Microsoft stickers that come on some
laptops.</span><span class="s s150">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s151">I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving
something away for free, and till recently a company giving anything
away for free could be pretty high-handed about it.</span> <span class="s s152">Sometimes it
reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the
more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.</span> 
<span class="s s153">The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.</span><span class="s s154">com, where 
you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you have
sit through a movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s155">At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord
it over users.</span> <span class="s s156">Never make users register, unless you need to in
order to store something for them.</span> <span class="s s157">If you do make users register, 
never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact,
don't even ask for their email address unless you need it for some
reason.</span> <span class="s s158">Don't ask them any unnecessary questions.</span> <span class="s s159">Never send them
email unless they explicitly ask for it.</span> <span class="s s160">Never frame pages you
link to, or open them in new windows.</span> <span class="s s161">If you have a free version 
and a pay version, don't make the free version too restricted.</span> <span class="s s162">And
if you find yourself asking "should we allow users to do x?</span><span class="s s163">"</span> <span class="s s164">just 
answer "yes" whenever you're unsure.</span> <span class="s s165">Err on the side of generosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s166">In How to Start a Startup I advised startups
never to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other
company offer a cheaper, easier solution.</span> <span class="s s167">Another way to fly low 
is to give users more power.</span> <span class="s s168">Let users do what they want.</span> <span class="s s169">If you 
don't and a competitor does, you're in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s170">iTunes is Web 2.</span><span class="s s171">0ish in this sense.</span> <span class="s s172">Finally you can buy individual
songs instead of having to buy whole albums. The recording industry
hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.</span> <span class="s s173">But it was
obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.</span>
<span class="s s174">[4]
Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.</span><span class="s s175">5.</span> 
<span class="s s176">Web 2.</span><span class="s s177">0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands giving
away DRMless songs for free.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s178">The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for
free that competitors charge for.</span> <span class="s s179">During the 90s a lot of people 
probably thought we'd have some working system for micropayments 
by now.</span> <span class="s s180">In fact things have gone in the other direction.</span> <span class="s s181">The most 
successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff
away for free.</span> <span class="s s182">Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad
sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the
previous generation of dating sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s183">Serving web pages is very, very cheap.</span> <span class="s s184">If you can make even a 
fraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit.</span> <span class="s s185">And
technology for targeting ads continues to improve.</span> <span class="s s186">I wouldn't be
surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an 
ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).</span></p>
<p><span class="s s187">Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to
make as little money as possible.</span> <span class="s s188">If you can figure out a way to
turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry,
so much the better, if all fifty million go to you.</span> <span class="s s189">Though indeed,
making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the
end, just as automating things often turns out to generate more
jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s190">The ultimate target is Microsoft.</span> <span class="s s191">What a bang that balloon is going
to make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative 
to MS Office.</span>
<span class="s s192">[5]
Who will?</span> <span class="s s193">Google?</span> <span class="s s194">They seem to be taking their
time.</span> <span class="s s195">I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old
hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.</span> <span class="s s196">(How hard
can it be?</span><span class="s s197">)</span></p>
<p><span class="s s198">The Common Thread</span></p>
<p><span class="s s199">Ajax, democracy, and not dissing users.</span> <span class="s s200">What do they all have in 
common?</span> <span class="s s201">I didn't realize they had anything in common till recently,
which is one of the reasons I disliked the term "Web 2.</span><span class="s s202">0" so much.</span>
<span class="s s203">It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened
to be new&mdash;that it didn't predict anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s204">But there is a common thread.</span> <span class="s s205">Web 2.</span><span class="s s206">0 means using the web the way
it's meant to be used.</span> <span class="s s207">The "trends" we're seeing now are simply
the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models
that got imposed on it during the Bubble.</span></p>
<p><span class="s s208">I realized this when I read an  interview with
Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.
[6]
</span></p><span class="s s209">&nbsp;
 Excite really never got the business model right at all. We fell 
 into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it
 adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old
 medium&acirc;&#128;&#148;which fails, and then the more appropriate models get
 figured out.
&nbsp;
It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years
after the Bubble burst. But in retrospect, something was happening:
the web was finding its natural angle of repose. The democracy 
component, for example&mdash;that's not an innovation, in the sense of
something someone made happen. That's what the web naturally tends
to produce.</span></div></div>
